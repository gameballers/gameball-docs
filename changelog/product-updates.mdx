<Update label="Play & Win Launch" description="A New Home for Games in the Widget">

We've introduced a new **Play & Win** section in the Gameball widget to make games easier to find, easier to understand, and more engaging for customers. Instead of appearing alongside regular earning actions, all game-based campaigns now live in one dedicated place.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/play-win-widget-section.png" alt="Play & Win section in widget" />
</Frame>

### What Is the Play & Win Section?

**Play & Win** is a new widget section that displays all active game campaigns in one place. It helps customers quickly discover games and clearly separates games from standard earning actions. [Learn about the Gameball Widget](/product-documentation/customer-widget/introduction-to-customer-widget).

The section appears automatically when at least one game is active and disappears when no games are available.

### What This Means for Your Customers

- Games are easier to discover and access
- All games are grouped in one dedicated section
- Each game appears as its own card with a banner, description, and icon
- The newest games appear first by default

### Supported Game Types

All existing and upcoming game campaigns are supported, including: Spin & Win, Slot Machine, Scratch & Win, Quiz, Puzzle, Match Cards, Shooter, Tap the Target, Stamps, and more.

### What Existing Gameball Customers Need to Do

If you already have game campaigns, **nothing changes immediately.** Your existing games will continue to appear under the **Earn** section. When you edit an existing game campaign, you'll be asked to add or update the game's banner through the customization section.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/game-banner-customization.png" alt="Game banner customization" />
</Frame>

Once completed, the game will automatically move from **Earn** to **Play & Win**. You can control the visibility of this section and manage the order of game cards from the **Play & Win options** tab under the General widget section. [Learn more](/product-documentation/customer-widget/start-configuring-profile/customizing-tabs-visibility-and-order-in-gameball-widget-settings).

### Customizing How Games Appear

From your dashboard, go to the desired campaign, click **Edit**, then **Customize Design**. Stay on the **Banner** tab to customize each game's icon, short description, and banner image.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/game-banner-customization-options.png" alt="Game banner customization options" />
