## 🔒 Gameball API V4.1 — Secure Integration Mode

We're excited to announce **API V4.1** — our most secure version yet, with mandatory SecretKey authentication and enhanced security controls!

---

### ✨ What's New

#### **Mandatory SecretKey Authentication**
All integration endpoints under `/api/v4.1/integrations/...` now require both APIKey and SecretKey headers. This ensures all integration traffic is server-to-server only.

#### **Enhanced Security Model**
- All integration APIs must be called from your backend
- Widget/mobile access requires per-customer session tokens
- No exposure of SecretKey in client-side code

#### **Minimum Version Enforcement**
Control which API versions are allowed from your Gameball Dashboard. Set a minimum version to reject older, less secure patterns.

### 🔄 Breaking Changes

<Warning>
**Mandatory SecretKey:** All v4.1 integration endpoints require both APIKey and SecretKey. Requests without SecretKey are rejected.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Server-Side Only:** Integration endpoints can no longer be called from browsers or mobile apps directly. All calls must go through your backend.
</Warning>

### 📚 Migration Guide

<Note>
**Migration Required:** If you're using v4.0, you'll need to update your integrations to include SecretKey headers and ensure all calls are made from your backend.
</Note>
