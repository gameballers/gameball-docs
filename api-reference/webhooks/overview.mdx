Want to stay updated on events happening in Gameball? Webhooks are the way to go! They let your app automatically receive real-time updates whenever something important happens.
With Gameball webhooks, you can:

* Keep your app synced when a customer's profile is updated.
* Trigger notifications to keep customers engaged.

This guide will walk you through the basics of using webhooks, with clear explanations and tips to help you get started.

## Examples of when your app might use webhooks

* **Notify customers about profile updates**: Send alerts when something in a customer's profile changes.
* **Forward notifications**: Keep customers informed by sending messages triggered by their actions in Gameball.
* **Update loyalty points**: Adjust a customer's points balance when their profile is updated.

## APIs for continuous polling vs. Webhooks for events data

Let's look at how they differ, using the `customer.notification.push` webhook topic as an example:

* **Polling APIs:** Your app constantly asks Gameball, "Did anything happen yet?" This can lead to unnecessary API calls, increased server load, and delayed updates.
* **Webhooks:** Gameball tells your app, "Here's the latest event!" This approach is faster, more efficient, and delivers data as soon as the event occurs.

By subscribing to a webhook like `customer.notification.push`, your app receives event data instantly, without the hassle of repetitive API requests.

### How it works

1. Your app subscribes to the **`customer.notification.push`** topic and listens for new notification push events.
2. Your app specifies a **`POST`** endpoint to receive webhooks for the **`customer.notification.push`** topic. This endpoint is where the app listens for webhooks.
3. Suppose now that a notification is pushed from Gameball system.
4. This triggers a webhook to be published to the **`customer.notification.push`** topic.
5. Gameball sends that webhook, which includes headers and an order payload, to the specified subscription endpoint.

## Key terminology

### Topic

Webhooks are grouped into topics, and your app subscribes to one or more of these topics to receive specific event updates.

#### What It Does

A webhook topic determines the type of event messages your app will receive. For instance, subscribing to the `customer.profile.updated` topic lets your app get notified whenever a customer's profile is updated.

#### Why It Matters

The topic name clearly identifies the kind of event, helping your app stay focused on relevant updates.

### Headers

Each webhook includes **headers** and a **payload**. The headers provide important metadata about the webhook.

```http
X-GB-Signature: '3fcb4a3b2d96e6f8363d3b5594290111d02139df'
X-GB-Webhook-Version: 'v4'
```

**`X-GB-Signature`**  
A security signature used to verify that the webhook is authentic and originates from Gameball.

**`X-GB-Webhook-Version`**  
Indicates the version of the webhook being used.

## Webhooks Retry Policy

<Warning>
If Gameball receives a non-2XX status code in response to a webhook, it will retry delivery up to three times.
</Warning>

The retry schedule is as follows:

* **1st Retry**: After 5 minutes
* **2nd Retry**: After 20 minutes  
* **3rd Retry**: After 60 minutes

<Note>
If all retries fail, the webhook request will be discarded.
