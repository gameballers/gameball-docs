Gameball provides two key webhook events to keep your systems updated in near-real-time:

1. **Customer Notification Push**  
   Triggered when Gameball generates a notification for a customer. This helps deliver timely updates like push notifications or SMS messages.

2. **Customer Profile Updated**  
   Triggered when a customer's profile changes. This ensures your app stays updated with changes like points, tier or referral details.

These webhooks help you stay in sync with customer activities and enhance their overall experience.
