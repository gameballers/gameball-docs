Gameballâ€™s **Order APIs** are built for e-commerce platforms and any system that needs to **track customer orders efficiently**.  
They streamline customer purchase management by combining multiple actions into a **single unified endpoint**.

<Info>
Instead of making multiple API calls (e.g., sending a purchase event + calculating cashback rewards), you can rely on the **Order API** to handle everything in one go.  
This makes integration easier and ensures a smooth customer experience.
