**Gameball** APIs are secured using API Keys to add an additional layer of protection to your account.  
Two types of keys are provided: the **API Key** and the **Secret Key** (also referred to as the transaction key).

- The **API Key** is used for regular, non-sensitive endpoints.  
- The **Secret Key** must be used along with the **API Key** when performing sensitive operations.

<Warning>
**Highly Important Note!**  
Your API keys carry significant privileges, so it's essential to keep them secure.  
Never share your **Secret Key** in publicly accessible areas, such as GitHub or client-side code.
</Warning>

For each API request, include your account's **API Key**, and in some cases, the **Secret Key** as well, in the request headers.  

ðŸ‘‰ For more details on how to retrieve your API Key and Secret Key, refer to our [Help Center](https://help.gameball.co/en/articles/3467114-get-your-account-integration-details-api-key-and-transaction-key).

## Example: Authentication with API Key

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/event' \
  --header 'APIKey: ue7eh32eiwlsncoko08u8b'
```

## Example: Authentication with API Key and Secret Key

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/transaction/cashback' \
  --header 'APIKey: ue7eh32eiwlsncoko08u8b' \
  --header 'SecretKey: kz7eh32eiwldlowbo08u5p'
```

## High Security Mode (Optional)

To enhance security across your integration, you can enable **High Security Mode** from your Gameball Dashboard.

<Warning>
**Highly Important Note!**  
Send all requests from the **server-side** to prevent exposing the Secret Key on the client side.  
Sending requests from the client-side could compromise your security, as the Secret Key could be exposed to users.
</Warning>

When this mode is enabled, **all API requests** â€” even those that typically require only the API Key â€” will also require the **Secret Key** in the request headers.

This ensures that **every API call** is authenticated with both keys, offering a stricter level of protection against unauthorized access.

<Note>
**Recommendation**: Enabling High Security Mode is advised for clients with heightened security requirements.  
Once activated, all integration endpoints will reject requests that do not include both `APIKey` and `SecretKey` headers.
