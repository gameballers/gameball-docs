title: "Rate Limiting"
---

Gameball API employs safeguards to protect against sudden bursts of traffic, ensuring platform stability.  
If you send too many requests in a short time, you may encounter error responses with status code **429 (Too Many Requests)**.

## Rate Limits

Gameball uses two levels of rate limiting:

- **Per-second limit:** A maximum number of read and write operations can be processed per second. This is the limit for concurrent requests handled at any given moment.  
- **Per-30s quota:** The total number of requests allowed over a 30-second window. This acts as an overall cap to ensure the system remains stable during sustained activity.

## Rate Limits Overview

Gameball API uses rate limiting to manage traffic across its endpoints.  
Instead of applying a uniform limit, the system uses distinct rate and quota "buckets" for different API resources and operations.  
This allows flexibility and ensures optimal system performance tailored to the specific needs of each resource.

- The **rate** defines the maximum number of requests allowed per second for a resource.  
- The **quota** specifies the total number of requests allowed within a 30-second window.  

### Rate Limits Table

| API Resource          | Method | Rate (requests/second) | Quota (requests/30 seconds) |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Transactions**      | GET    | 30                     | 360                         |
|                       | POST   | 30                     | 360                         |
| **Coupons**           | All    | 30                     | 360                         |
|                       | POST   | 30                     | 360                         |
| **Customers**         | GET    | 100                    | 1200                        |
|                       | POST   | 30                     | 360                         |
| **Events**            | Any    | 100                    | 1200                        |
| **Orders** (Tracking) | Any    | 30                     | 360                         |
| **Orders** (Cashback) | Any    | 1000                   | 15,000                      |
| **Others**            | Any    | 30                     | 360                         |

If the rate exceeds either the **per-second** or **per-30s limit**, a `429 Too Many Requests` error will be returned.

<Info>
ðŸ’¡ **Upcoming Feature**: To handle bulk operations and avoid hitting API rate limits, **batch APIs** will be released by the end of Q4 2024.  
This will allow you to process multiple requests more efficiently.

## Common Causes and Mitigations

Rate limiting can occur for several reasons. The most common scenarios include:

- **High request volume in quick succession:**  
  Sending many closely-timed requests, such as during large data analysis or migration, can lead to rate limiting.  
  âœ… To avoid this, control the request rate from your side (see *Handling Rate Limiting Gracefully*).

- **Sudden spikes in traffic (e.g., flash sales):**  
  A sudden influx of requests, like during a flash sale, can cause rate limiting.  
  While the API limits are designed to accommodate typical traffic, you may want to prepare in advance for events expected to generate a surge in requests.
