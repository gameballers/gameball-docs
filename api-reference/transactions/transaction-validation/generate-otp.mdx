## Generate OTP

The API call generates a new one-time password (OTP) for redeeming or holding loyalty points and sends it via SMS. This service ensuring that only authorized transactions can be completed with the provided OTP.

<Warning>
This API is effective only if SMS & OTP are enabled in your Gameball account. Contact support for more information.

<Note>
**Channel Merging Available**
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).
