## Add Manual Transaction

This API allows for the manual addition or deduction of points for a customer in Gameball. It provides flexibility in managing loyalty points, enabling adjustments based on specific needs or circumstances.

<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.
