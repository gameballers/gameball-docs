## Transactions

The Transactions API provides a powerful suite of tools to manage customer points and reward transactions within Gameball. With these APIs, you can handle all customer interactions involving points and rewards, from viewing transaction histories to managing points redemptions, issuing refunds, and more. This makes it easy for businesses to create tailored rewards programs, encouraging customer loyalty with actions that add, redeem, or adjust points independently of purchase activities.

## Available APIs

### Cashback & Redemptions
Reward customers through cashback, redeem points, or issue refunds as necessary. The Cashback & Redemptions API enables flexible management of point balances based on customer purchases or other qualifying transactions.

### Hold Management
Control points with hold actions, letting you place, view, or release held points before redemption. Useful for reserving points until a transaction is confirmed.

### Transaction Management
Track customer transactions by listing transaction histories or adding manual point adjustments. The Transaction Management API records all point activities, from rewards to deductions, providing transparency and control over customer transactions.

### Transaction Validation
Add a layer of security to redemption transactions by generating one-time passwords (OTPs) for verification. The Transaction Validation API ensures that point redemptions are authorized, protecting both customers and the platform through secure OTP validation.
