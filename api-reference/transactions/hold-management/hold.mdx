<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.
