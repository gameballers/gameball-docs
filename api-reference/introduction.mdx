## Gameball Developers Guide

Gameball is a customer engagement and loyalty platform that provides a ready‑made widget and REST APIs to power rewards, gamification, and retention across your apps and sites. Instead of building these capabilities from scratch, integrate the SDKs and APIs and customize via the Gameball Dashboard.

## REST API

  - Coupons
  - Configurations (rewards, program, widget)
  - Leaderboard, Batches

## Authentication

Authenticate requests with a Bearer token. Provide the token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
