## Gameball Developers Guide

Gameball is a customer engagement and loyalty platform that provides a ready‑made widget and REST APIs to power rewards, gamification, and retention across your apps and sites. Instead of building these capabilities from scratch, integrate the SDKs and APIs and customize via the Gameball Dashboard.

  - Coupons
  - Configurations (rewards, program, widget)
  - Leaderboard, Batches

## Authentication

Before making any requests, it's important to understand how Gameball authenticates incoming API calls.
