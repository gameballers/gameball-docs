## Batches

The **Batch API** provides a set of powerful tools for efficiently processing multiple requests in a single operation. These APIs enable bulk creation, updates, and transactional operations while reducing network overhead. By using batch processing, you can streamline data synchronization, automate large-scale operations, and improve overall system performance.

## Available Endpoints

### Batch Creation
Allows bulk processing of customer data, orders, balance inquiries, adjustments, cashback rewards, redemptions, and events. This improves efficiency by handling multiple records in a single request.

- **[Customer Data](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/customer-data)** - Bulk customer data processing
- **[Orders](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/orders)** - Bulk order processing
- **[Balance Inquiries](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/balance-inquiries)** - Bulk balance inquiry processing
- **[Adjustments](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/adjustments)** - Bulk balance adjustments
- **[Cashback Rewards](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/cashback-rewards)** - Bulk cashback reward processing
- **[Redemptions](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/redemptions)** - Bulk redemption processing
- **[Events](/api-reference/batches/batch-creation/events)** - Bulk event processing

### Batch Management
Provides tools to monitor and control batch jobs. You can **check the status and results** of a batch operation or **stop an ongoing execution** if needed.

- **[Batch Management Overview](/api-reference/batches/batch-management/index)** - Overview of batch management capabilities
- **[Check Batch Status](/api-reference/batches/batch-management/check-status)** - Monitor batch job status and results
- **[Stop Batch Execution](/api-reference/batches/batch-management/stop-execution)** - Stop ongoing batch operations

## Key Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Process multiple records in a single request
- **Performance**: Reduce network overhead and improve system performance
- **Scalability**: Handle large-scale operations with ease
- **Automation**: Streamline data synchronization and bulk operations
- **Monitoring**: Track batch job progress and manage execution

<Info>
**Note:** Batch operations require both `apikey` and `secretkey` headers for authentication.
