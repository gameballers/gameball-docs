## Burn Coupon

This API marks a coupon as used/consumed, preventing it from being used again. This is typically called after a successful transaction to ensure the coupon cannot be reused.

<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).
