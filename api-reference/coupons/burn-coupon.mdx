This API processes the use of one or more coupons associated with a customer in Gameball. By providing customer details and a list of coupons, this endpoint marks the coupons as redeemed, completing the transaction. Optionally, a `lockReference` can be included to burn previously locked coupons.

<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Omni-Channel Handling Guide](/tutorials-new/experiences/more/omni-channel).
