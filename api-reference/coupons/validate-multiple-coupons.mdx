## Validate Multiple Coupons

This API validates multiple coupons at once and checks their eligibility for use by a customer. It supports a locking feature where setting the `lock` flag to `True` reserves all valid coupons by creating lock references. This ensures the coupons cannot be used by others during the lock session, preventing conflicts or double usage.

<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).
