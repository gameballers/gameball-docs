title: "Validate Multiple Coupons"
description: "Validate multiple coupons at once and optionally lock them for exclusive use."
openapi: 'POST /api/v4.0/integrations/coupons/validate'
languages: ["curl", "javascript", "python", "csharp"]

This API validates a list of coupons and checks their eligibility for use by a customer. It also supports a locking feature, where setting the `lock` flag to `True` reserves eligible coupons by creating hold references. This ensures that locked coupons cannot be used by others during the lock session, preventing conflicts or double usage. By default, the `lock` flag is `False`, allowing only validation without reserving the coupons.

**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.
