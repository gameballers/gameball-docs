**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).

## Request Body

<ParamField path="customerId" type="string" required>
Unique identifier for the customer that you can reference across the customer's whole lifetime. Could be a database ID, random string, email, or anything that uniquely identifies the customer.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="email" type="string">
Customer's email address.

<Info>
This is required if your account uses email-based channel merging.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="mobile" type="string">
Customer's mobile number.

<Info>
This is required if your account uses mobile-based channel merging.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="cartId" type="string" required>
Identifier for the shopping cart associated with the order.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="totalPrice" type="float">
The total cost of the order, including all item prices, shipping, taxes, and tips. This value does not account for any discounts or coupons applied and is not used for calculations in Gameball; it is solely saved as historical data linked to the order. Must be a positive value.

**Example:** A customer purchases items worth $120, including taxes and shipping. Even if a $20 coupon is applied, the **totalPrice** remains $120 as it represents the original cost of the order before any discounts are applied.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="totalShipping" type="float">
The total shipping cost associated with the order. This should be included when a **Free Shipping** promotion is configured in your account, enabling the system to calculate and apply the appropriate discount to the cart.

The original price of a single product before any tax or discount is applied. This reflects the cost of one unit of the item, not the total for multiple quantities in an order.
