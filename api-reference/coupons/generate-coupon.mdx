<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Omni-Channel Handling Guide](/tutorials-new/experiences/more/omni-channel).

## Request Body

<ParamField path="customerId" type="string" required>
Unique identifier for the customer that you can reference across the customer's whole lifetime. Could be a database ID, random string, email or anything that uniquely identifies the customer.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="email" type="string">
Customer's email address.

<Info>
This is required if your account uses email-based channel merging.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="mobile" type="string">
Customer's mobile number.

<Info>
This is required if your account uses mobile-based channel merging.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ruleId" type="integer" required>
The ID of the redemption rule that will be applied to create the coupon. This rule dictates how the coupon will function, such as whether it grants a percentage discount, free shipping, a fixed-amount discount, or a free product. The `ruleId` is tied to a predefined redemption rule configured through the Gameball dashboard, ensuring the coupon adheres to the set conditions of that rule. Additionally, the redemption rule determines how many points will be redeemed to generate the coupon.

You can retrieve your configured redemption rules and their associated IDs by using the **Redemption Configuration API**.
