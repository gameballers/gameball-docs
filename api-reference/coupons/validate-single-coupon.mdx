title: "Validate Single Coupon"
description: "Validate a single coupon and optionally lock it for exclusive use."
openapi: 'POST /api/v4.0/integrations/coupons/{code}/validate'
languages: ["curl", "javascript", "python", "csharp"]
---

This API validates a single coupon identified by `{code}` and checks its eligibility for use by a customer. It also supports a locking feature, where setting the `lock` flag to `True` reserves the coupon by creating a lock reference. This ensures the coupon cannot be used by others during the lock session, preventing conflicts or double usage. By default, the `lock` flag is `False`, allowing only validation without reserving the coupon.

<Info>
**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).
