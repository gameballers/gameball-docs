## Payment

The Payment APIs are designed for fintech or any system that needs to track customer payments efficiently. These APIs streamline managing customer payments by offering a unified entry point that triggers all necessary internal flows—such as recording the payment and calculating rewards or cashback—based on your configured rules and campaigns.

By using the Payment API, you avoid multiple calls (for example, sending a payment event and then calculating cashback). Instead, a single call coordinates the full workflow to simplify integration and ensure a smooth customer experience.
