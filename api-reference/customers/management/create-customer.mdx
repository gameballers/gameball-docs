This API enables you to create or update a customer profile in Gameball using a unique `customerId`. Serving as a consistent identity, this `customerId` allows you to track a customer's entire journey, linking them to all associated events, purchases, and loyalty activities across their lifetime. This ensures comprehensive customer management within the Gameball platform.

**Channel Merging Available**  
If your system uses different customer IDs across multiple channels (e.g., online and offline), Gameball's channel merging feature helps unify customer profiles. By including the customer's mobile number or email (based on your merging configuration) with each request, Gameball will combine activities into a single profile.

For more information, head to the [Channel Merging Guide](/tutorials/channel-merging-guide).
