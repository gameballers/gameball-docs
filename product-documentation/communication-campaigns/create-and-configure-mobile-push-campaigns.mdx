Mobile push notifications serve as a powerful tool for engaging users and driving key actions within your mobile application. With Gameball's Mobile Push Communication Campaign feature, you can deliver targeted messages directly to their customers' devices, even when they're not actively using the app.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Firebase Integration is required to send push notifications.

## Understanding Mobile Push Notifications

Mobile push notifications are brief, timely messages that appear on users' mobile device screens, allowing businesses to communicate with their audience in real-time. Unlike other forms of communication, mobile push notifications are highly visible and are less likely to be overlooked by users. Here are some **ideas** for campaigns that you can send out:

- Ask Loyal Customers For Referrals
- Promote Social Engagement
- Offer them a Welcome Reward
- Ask them to subscribe to the Newsletter

- Define what **Triggers** sending this mobile push to your audience. You can choose between:
  - **Scheduled Based:** All your audience will receive this mobile push at a scheduled time. You can decide between:
    - **One-time:** Mobile Push will be sent only once
    - **Recurring:** Mobile Push will be sent more than once
  - **Action Based:** All of your audience will receive this mobile push once they complete a specific action. All you have to do is select the event from the drop-down and add its filters.

- Click **Save and Continue**

### Step 2: Scheduling

Now let's set the timing for sending the push notification, based on the trigger that you chose in the previous step.

- In case you chose **Scheduled Based**, and for it to be sent **One-Time**, you can choose one of these options:
  - **Now**: The mobile push will be sent once the campaign is set live
  - **Later**: The mobile push will be sent on the Start Date that you choose

- In case you chose **Scheduled Based**, and for it to be **recurring**, you need to set up the following:
  - **Start Date:** The date that we will start sending the mobile push
  - **Repetition:** The number of times that the mobile push should be sent, and the duration between each one.
  - **End Date:** The date when we should stop sending the mobile push. You can choose:
    - **Never**: the mobile push will always be sent out
    - **Till**: A certain date that the mobile push will stop being sent out after.
  - **Configure frequency:** Specify how often customers will receive the mobile push:
    - An unlimited number of messages per customer (Default)
    - Limit the Number of messages per customer (Choose the Maximum number)

- In case you chose **Action Based**, you need to set up the following:
  - **Start Date:** The date that we will start sending the mobile push
  - **End Date:** The date when we should stop sending the mobile push. You can choose:
    - **Never**: the mobile push will always be sent out
    - **Till**: A certain date that the mobile push will stop being sent out after.
  - **Configure frequency:** Specify how often customers will receive the mobile push:
    - **Default**: Each customer will keep receiving messages without any capping until the end of the campaign
    - **Custom**: Choose the number of times the mobile push should be sent out, the duration between each mobile push, and the maximum number of times the mobile push should be sent.

- Click **Save and Continue**

### Step 3: Compose

- Customize the content and design of the communication campaign, including the message title and body text.
- Craft a compelling message that grabs users' attention and encourages action, such as promoting new collections, products, sales, or promo codes.

- Click **Save and Continue**

### Step 4: Goal

- Define the goal of the communication campaign, such as increasing product views, driving conversions, or boosting engagement.
- Set event triggers and timeframes to monitor user actions in response to the communication campaign.

- Click **Save and Continue**

### Step 5: Preview

- Review and edit the configured settings to ensure alignment with campaign objectives and user preferences.
- Send a test message to preview the communication campaign before sending it to users.

- Lastly, click **Set live**

## Viewing and Managing Communication Campaigns
