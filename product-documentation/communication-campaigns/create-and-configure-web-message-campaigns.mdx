- Define what **triggers** are sending this web message to your audience. You can choose between:
  - **Action Based:** All of your audience will receive this web message once they complete a specific action. All you have to do is select the event from the drop-down and add its filters.
  - **Page Visit Based:** Each of your audience will receive this message when they visit a specific page on your website.

### Step 2: Scheduling

Now let's set the timing for sending the web message, based on the trigger that you chose in the previous step.

- In case you chose **Page Visit Based**, you need to set up the following:
  - **Start Date:** The date that we will start sending the web messages
  - **Repetition:** The number of times that the web message should be sent, and the duration between each one.
  - **End Date:** The date when we should stop sending the web messages. You can choose:
    - **Never**: the web messages will always be sent out
    - **Till**: A certain date after which the web messages will stop being sent out.
  - **Configure frequency:** Specify how often customers will receive the web message:
    - An unlimited number of messages per customer (Default)
    - Limit the Number of messages per customer (Choose the Maximum number)
