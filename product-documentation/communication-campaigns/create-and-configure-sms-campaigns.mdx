SMS campaigns are an effective and immediate way to connect with customers through their mobile devices. With high open and response rates, SMS serves as a valuable communication channel for time-sensitive promotions, transactional updates, and personalized offers that drive real-time engagement.

## Utilizing Gameball's SMS Communication Campaigns

### Step 2: Scheduling

Now let's set the timing for sending the SMS, based on the trigger that you chose in the previous step.

- In case you choose **Scheduled Based**, and for it to be sent **one time**, you can choose one of these options:
  - **Now**: The SMS will be sent once the campaign is set live
  - **Later**: The SMS will be sent on the Start Date that you choose

- In case you chose **Scheduled Based**, and for it to be **recurring**, you need to set up the following:
  - **Start Date:** The date that we will start sending the SMS
  - **Repetition:** The number of times that the SMS should be sent, and the duration between each one.
  - **End Date:** The date when we should stop sending the SMS. You can choose:
    - **Never**: the SMS will always be sent out
    - **Till**: A certain date that the SMS will stop being sent out after.
  - **Configure frequency:** Specify how often customers will receive the SMS:
    - An unlimited number of messages per customer (Default)
    - Limit the Number of messages per customer (Choose the Maximum number)
