Gameball's Communication Campaigns, formerly known as Outbound, empower you to tailor messages for various purposes, including acquisition, retention, customer journey facilitation, and engagement. This feature serves as a versatile tool to complement campaigns and enhance program performance.

## Types of Communication Campaigns

### Emails

Email marketing is a ubiquitous strategy across industries to boost sales, conversion rates, and retention. Unlike other channels, emails are always accessible by customers, ensuring message permanence. Emails are sent to registered customers and guests who have previously made at least one order. Segmentation and triggers enable personalized email delivery based on customer information or actions.

### Web Messages

Web messages enable real-time communication with customers during their platform journey. Ideal for upselling, alerts, and motivating customers to take action or complete and win reward campaigns. Pop-up messages prompt customers to engage with campaigns, daily deals, or offers, driving conversion rates. Customizable triggers ensure the timely delivery of web messages tailored to customer behavior.
