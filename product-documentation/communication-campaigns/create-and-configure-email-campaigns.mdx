- In case you chose **Scheduled Based**, and for it to be sent **One-Time**, you can choose one of these options:
  - **Now**: The email will be sent once the campaign is set live
  - **Later**: The email will be sent on the Start Date that you choose

  - **Repetition:** The number of times that the email should be sent, and the duration between each one.
  - **End Date:** The date when we should stop sending the emails. You can choose:
    - **Never**: the emails will always be sent out
    - **Till**: A certain date after which the emails will stop being sent out.
  - **Configure frequency:** Specify how often customers will receive the email:
    - Unlimited number of messages per customer (Default)
    - Limit the Number of messages per customer (Choose the Maximum number)
