On Shopify, through the Gameball customer widget, your customers are able to convert their points to vouchers, discount codes, get free items, or free shipping in exchange for these points. Gameball integrates with Shopify's native coupon engine, ensuring a seamless and automated process where unique coupon codes are generated for customers directly through the widget interface.

Before you continue, make sure you have configured the following:

- Enable points redemption, read [Wallet Points Configurations](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system).
- The points value and expiry with the suitable configuration to your store, read [How to set the equivalent value and expiry of wallet points?](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system)

<Note>Both value and expiry will be configured by default during the Gameball onboarding wizard. Additionally, when a customer redeems points through the Gameball widget, the application interacts with Shopify to generate unique discount codes, which are displayed instantly to the customer. Administrators can find these codes in the "Discounts" section of Shopify Admin.</Note>

Your customer should follow the steps below to redeem their points:

- Once you enable points redemption, your customers will see a new tab inside the widget, as shown below, which is the **Redeem** tab under their points.

- Under the **Coupons** tab, customers could also redeem the coupons that are automatically created if their points is equal to or more than the coupon value.

<Note>By clicking **Apply Coupon**, the customer will automatically find the coupon applied during checkout, and they will not need to paste the code themselves. To manage these discount codes, admins can navigate to the "Discounts" section in the Shopify Admin dashboard, where all generated coupons are stored for review and management.</Note>
