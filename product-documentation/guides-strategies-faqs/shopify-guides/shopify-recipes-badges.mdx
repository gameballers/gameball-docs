Through Gameball, you can add a game-like flavor to your customers' experience. Turn your product categories into badges collected and achieved by your customers and added to the Gameball widget.

## How will this work?

Every category on your Shopify store will have a badge. When your customers buy from these categories, they will earn these badges. For example:

### Characters Shirts Store

For example, your store has different shirt categories; every category will have a badge like the ones below:

</Frame>

### Kids Toys Store

For example, your store has different toys/gadget categories; every category will have a badge like the ones below:

### Online Hypermarket

For example, your online market has different categories; every category will have a badge like the ones below:
