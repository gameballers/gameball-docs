In this article, we will discuss significant enhancements to our Outbounds feature, aimed at providing greater control and visibility over your email usage. With the introduction of email limits and consumption tracking, managing your email outreach has never been more straightforward.

## What are the limits?

Our **PRO** and **Guru** plans will come with a generous email limit of 10,000 emails per billing cycle. This limit ensures that you can effectively reach out to your audience without worrying about exceeding your capacity.

## How Does It Work?

When you navigate to your billing page, you'll notice a new addition: the Email Consumption card. This card provides real-time insights into your email usage, allowing you to monitor how many emails you've sent against your allocated limit.

## Managing Plan Transitions

We understand that your business needs may change over time. That's why we've made transitioning between plans seamless:

- **Case 1:** Downgrading from PRO/Guru to Free/Starter? Your email consumption will reset to "0 of 0," ensuring no emails are sent beyond your new plan's limit.
- **Case 2:** Downgrading from PRO/Guru to Free/Starter then upgrading back to PRO within the same billing cycle? Your email consumption will retain its previous status, reflecting your 10,000 email limit.
- **Case 3:** Upgrading to PRO in a subsequent billing cycle after downgrading? Your email consumption will reset, giving you a fresh start with your 10,000 email allocation.

## Consumption Alerts:

When you approach your email limit, we'll send you timely alerts to notify you of your consumption progress:

- **80% Consumption Alert:** You'll receive an email notification when you've consumed 80% of your allocated emails for the billing cycle. This alert serves as a gentle reminder to monitor your usage and consider adjusting your plan if needed.
- **100% Consumption Alert:** Upon reaching 100% of your email limit, you'll receive another email notification. This alert signals that you've exhausted your allocated emails for the current billing cycle.

## No Hidden Charges

We believe in transparent pricing. If you exceed your email limit, no extra charges will apply. Instead, any additional emails sent beyond your limit will be blocked until the start of your next billing cycle, when you can start resending them again.

<Info>Email notifications are a separate feature that allows you to send customers emails when they achieve certain milestones (like earning cashback, completing reward campaigns, or reaching new tiers). Email notifications do not have an outbound charge limit and are available under certain packages.
