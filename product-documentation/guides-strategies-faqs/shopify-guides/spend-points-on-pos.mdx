First, ensure that you have enabled points redemption; [Learn more](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system). Customers will not be able to redeem their points if the points redemption feature is not activated.

You also need to make sure to upgrade your Shopify POS version to make use of this feature.

Follow the steps below on your Shopify to enable this feature:

- Select the item your customer is purchasing
