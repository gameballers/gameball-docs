If you are running both a Shopify online store and an offline retail store using Shopify POS, you can also let your in-store customers get rewards through Gameball.

## How to use Gameball Shopify POS

Once you install Gameball on your Shopify account, it will be automatically available to both your Shopify's online store and POS channels.

## How to enable Gameball on Shopify POS

Use the same way to publish Gameball on your online store. Learn [how to publish Gameball experience & widget on your Shopify store](/product-documentation/guides-strategies-faqs/supportive-guides/publish-gameball-experience)

## What programs can be used to reward your in-store customers?

<Note>You must create an account for your customers using their email to get rewards from Gameball, the same as the online experience.</Note>

Below is a list of available programs that can reward your in-store customers.

### Tiers

Even for your in-store customers, you can tier them across your Gameball tiers based on the amount spent, points, number of completed orders, number of referrals, or score.

### Earn Points

Your in-store customers will be treated the same as your online customers, so that they will get all configured programs:

For ways to earn that depend on events, on POS, we will have only one Shopify event working, which is "Place Order." Learn more about [how to use events on Shopify](/product-documentation/guides-strategies-faqs/shopify-guides/using-events)

You can also differentiate between ways to earn rewards through POS and Online Shopify.

### Redeem Points/Cashback

You can give your in-store customers points based on the paid amount.

So, if you have already configured all the above programs, your customers will get rewards as well.

## How do customers redeem their points during a purchase

You can now create two types of point redemption for POS customers:

- **POS All Points Redemption:** Let your customers redeem all their points at once during transactions at physical stores using Shopify POS.
- **POS Fixed amount coupons:** Let your customers exchange their points for a fixed amount coupon. Ex. USD20 coupon.
- **POS Percentage Coupons:** Let them exchange their points for a percentage discount. Ex. 20% discount coupon.

To enable any of the previous POS coupon creations, create a new redemption rule for POS. Follow the steps under this [article to enable this option](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system).
