### Auto-tagging

The process will be as follows:

- Add a tag to your customer on Shopify.
- The tag will be automatically created on Gameball (If it is a new tag).
- This tag will be added to the customer on Gameball.

### Auto-untagging

The process will be as follows:

- Remove a tag from your customer on Shopify.
- This tag will be removed automatically from the customer on Gameball.

<Note>Sometimes, the auto-tagging and auto-untagging take time, between 1-5 mins.</Note>
