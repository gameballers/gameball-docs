**This article applies to the [Reward Campaigns program](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/reward-campaign-intro) only.**

## Create a Reward Campaign That is Action-Based

While creating a [reward campaign with type **Action-Based**](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-action-based-reward-campaign), you can use the "**Source**" key to differentiate between a POS and an Online store.

This key will always return "web" and "POS" to let you differentiate. So, in case you want this campaign applied to both channels, do not use this key and use it to separate both channels.
