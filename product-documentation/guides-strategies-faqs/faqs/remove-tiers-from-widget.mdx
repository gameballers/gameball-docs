If the tiers program does not suit you and you do not want to use tiers as an element to make your customers engaged, you can remove tiers from your loyalty program by following the steps below:

## **Step 1: Delete configured** tier**s**

<Note>Skip this step if you want only to hide the tiers tab from the widget but still want to enroll your customers in the tiers program and let them tier up.</Note>

On the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, go to **Programs > VIP Tiers**.

## **Step 2: Hide the** tier**s tab from the widget**

Only the first tier is left, and all the manually added tiers are removed. Customers can no longer tier up; however, the tiers tab still exists, showing the basic tier that can not be removed. To completely hide the tiers tab from the Gameball widget, follow the steps below:

On the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, go to **Widget > General: Visibility tab**.

Under **VIP** **Tier**, choose between **Show** and **Hide**, and click **Save**.

</Frame>

After refreshing your website, you will find that the tiers tab has been completely removed, and your customers will neither see the tiers program nor tier up.
