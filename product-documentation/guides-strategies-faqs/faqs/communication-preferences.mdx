If you have been a Gameball user for over a week, then you have probably received at least one report email with data about your progress during the last week. If you do not need that email sent to you at all, or you prefer it be sent to you less frequently, you can do that through short steps.

## What is the Weekly Engagement Report email?

Gameball sends you that report so that you can take a quick look at the overall progress of your configured loyalty program. Here is the information that you will find in the email:

- **General Activities:** Includes your customers' data like the newly enrolled customers, overactive customers, and the number of referred customers.
- **Points Activities:** The total points that all customers have accumulated, and your customers' total number of points redeemed by your customers.
- **Programs Activities:** Include information about the customers' interactions with your configured programs, such as:
  - The number of customers who tiered up.
  - The number of customers who completed new reward campaigns.
  - The number of referrals.
  - The number of customers who have purchased rewards.
- **Current Total Enrolled Customers:** The total number of customers who joined the loyalty program, including the inactive ones.
