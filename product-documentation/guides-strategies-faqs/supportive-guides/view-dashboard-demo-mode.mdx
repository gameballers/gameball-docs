**Platform**

Available to no-platform (self-serve) customers only

For **Self-Serve** customers only. If you are new to Gameball dashboard experience and you still have not filled your program with data about your customers, you can now view the dashboard on **Demo Mode** just to get a glimpse of how the dashboard would look like filled with data and program configurations.

The data you will find once you get to the dashboard demo mode is dummy; this means they do not represent actual information of real customers or of launched programs or campaigns.

## How to view the dashboard on Demo Mode

It takes only one click to jump from your real dashboard to a demo mode. Just click on **Settings >** **Demo Accoun.**
