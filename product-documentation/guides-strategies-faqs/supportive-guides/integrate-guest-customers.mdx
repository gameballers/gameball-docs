**Available for all Gameball customers**

By Default, when activating your Gameball loyalty program, only customers who have signed up can engage with your configured loyalty programs and can get rewarded for their achievements. You can now also include guests (customers who have not signed up) and reward them for some of their achievements.

## How can you enable guests to become part of your rewards and loyalty program?

On **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, go to **Settings > Admin Settings > Programs Participation**, under **Customers**, click **Programs Participation**

Then choose **All your customers including guests**, and click **Save**

<Note>Gameball analytics data for guest customers has not been logged separately before this option is enabled; the previous data is collective for all customers.</Note>

Once you have enabled all types of customers to be part of your rewards program, two significant changes will apply:

- Guest customers will be able to actively engage in most of your configured loyalty programs.
- Data about your guest customers will appear on your dashboard in the [Customer Section](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/gameball-customers/introduction-to-customers-on-gameball) and the [Customers Activities](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/your-customers/customer-activity-log) page of your dashboard, along with registered customers' data.

</Frame>

Guest customers have the same info as registered customers, such as:

- creation date
- ID
- Email
- Level
- Leveling up method
- Points Balance

### Filtering to view Guests-only data:

If you want to view only registered customers or only guests, you can filter the customer list by doing the following:

Choose "Customer Type" as your filter, then choose "Customer with Account" or "Guest"

<Note>
All the current actions in the customer profile should apply normally to guests:
Include/Exclude, Adjust Balance, Adjust Level, Reward Campaigns, and Assign Tag.
</Note>

## Which types of action can you apply to your guests through the Gameball dashboard?

Guest customers can have the following action applied:

- Add Achievement Manually
- Tag Filtered Customers
- Include/Exclude Customers
- Update/Migrate Customers
- Reward a Campaign
- Add/Deduct Points

## Which types of programs and rewards will the guests be included in, and which will they be excluded from?

Guests are **included** in:

- **Cashback:** same Cashback rules configured, will be applied by default to guests as well
- **Redemption:** Guest customers will not be able to redeem their rewards unless they signup.
- **Reward Campaigns:** _guests can achieve the following reward campaign types **only**:_
  - Scheduled
  - Event-based
- **Tiers:** The Tier program applies normally to guests.
- **Email notifications:** Just like customers, guests will receive emails when they complete a milestone or achieve any of the above programs.

<Note>guests have to register their email during the checkout process when placing an order to start receiving the configured email notifications.</Note>

Guests are **excluded** from:

- **Referral:** Guests will not be able to refer other friends, however, they might receive a reward if they are referred by a registered customer, and if your referral rule configurations allow guests to be rewarded.
- **Reward Campaigns:** _guests **cannot** achieve the following reward campaign types:_
  - signup
  - birthday
  - anniversary
  - daily streak
  - Social Media
- **Points Redemption:** Guests can only win points, however, they will not be able to redeem them unless they sign up.

<Note>When a guest customer creates an account, they will be able to find all the rewards they have won before creating an account.</Note>
