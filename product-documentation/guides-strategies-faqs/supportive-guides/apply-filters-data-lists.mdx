<Warning>Applying multiple filters works subsequently, which means the second filter created will filter the outcome list of the first filter. Make sure you apply the more general filters first, then the more specific ones.</Warning>

## How to sort data?

On the right of every filter bar, you will find a drop-down list. You will be able to choose how to re-order and view your data according to your priorities.
