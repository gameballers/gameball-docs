Your customers are now able to share their progress with people they know every time they complete an achievement. This will give you exposure and will boost your social media presence.

Platforms this feature supports:

1. Facebook
2. Twitter

Below is how it looks on your customer widget. Once a customer clicks on one of the icons, Facebook or Twitter, a new window will pop up so that they can log in to their accounts and share their progress.
