title: "What Events Does Gameball Fire Automatically Across Platforms?"
description: "Learn about the automatically tracked events in Gameball vs events that require technical integration."

Gameball offers a set of **standard events** that are automatically tracked and sent by default, without the need for additional technical integration. These events are available out-of-the-box across different platforms and allow you to start capturing valuable customer actions right away.

In contrast, if you'd like to track **custom or advanced events** beyond this list, you can do so using the **Track Event API**, which requires developer integration. This article explains both categories: automatically fired events and events that need to be tracked through the API.

This article will walk you through the list of standard events Gameball fires automatically, along with the platforms where they're supported.

## **Automatically Fired Events**

The following events are triggered automatically by Gameball:

| **Event** | **Platform** | **Event Properties** |

<Note>Please note that the above are the only events automatically triggered by Gameball.</Note>

While standard events are ready to go, there are many situations where you may want to track specific customer interactions unique to your business. These can include actions that Gameball does not automatically capture, such as engagement with certain features, custom purchase flows, or any other key behaviors you define.

To do this, you can use our APIs to send other events. Unlike the automatically fired events, these require some level of technical integration to set up.
