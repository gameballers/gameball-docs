Score and Points are both units often used as rewards to customers who completed different actions or reward campaigns; however, each has a different role, and they both represent different kinds of rewards. [Learn more about the difference between scores and points.](/product-documentation/guides-strategies-faqs/faqs/points-vs-score)

If the words "Score" and "Points" do not appeal to you or match your brand theme, you can set different names through the Gameball dashboard.

## Score

The score is the unit that represents the customer's status; it increases with the more achievements your customers complete. The score also allows your customer to tier up and helps them keep track of their progress. **Suggested names for score**:

- Gems
- Freebies
- Crystals
- Stars

<Note>To use score as the main reward system, you can do that while creating a tier-up method. [Learn more](/product-documentation/programs/vip-tiers/tier-settings/tiering-up-methods).</Note>

## Points

Points are your internal currency. Customers collect them with every achievement they complete, and they can be redeemed later on by the customer. **Suggested names for points**:

- Coins
- Tokens
- Miles

## How to configure point names on Gameball

Follow the steps below to configure the above on Gameball:
