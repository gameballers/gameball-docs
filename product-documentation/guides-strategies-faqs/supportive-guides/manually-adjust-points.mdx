You might face situations where you will need to manually add points as a form of compensation, for example, or you will need to deduct points that were earned by mistake. You can choose to manually add or remove these points to one customer or all your customers simultaneously.

## Adding and Deducting Points from All Customers

Follow these steps to add or remove points from all customers manually. On the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, go to the **Customers Section**, do not select any customer, and click **Add/Deduct Points.**
