You can choose to include a customer in your loyalty experience so that they enjoy all the configured programs and rewards, or you can choose to completely exclude all or some of your customers.

## What is the result of including or excluding a customer?

**In case of including customers:**

By default, all customers are **included** in the rewards program once you activate your program, meaning, they will find the widget and will be rewarded for their engagement based on your previously configured programs.

**In case of excluding a customer:**

This customer will no longer see the widget, nor will they be rewarded for any sort of actions they take on your platform. In this case, they will interact with your platform as if no rewards system is deployed. The customer will also not receive any type of notification or communication campaign that is active on your system.

## How to include or exclude one, some, or all customers?

To include or exclude all customers at once, on the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, navigate to the **Customers Page**, click **More**, then **Include/Exclude Customer**.

### **How to include or exclude one customer only**

To include or exclude a specific customer, you can navigate to their eternal profile page on the dashboard, then switch on/off the **Include Toggle**.

<Note>This is also where you can check if that customer is included in the rewards program or not.</Note>

<Warning>When you apply the include or exclude action on all or a group of customers, if some of these customers are already included/excluded, then this action will apply normally and will just ignore the customers with the same status as the applied action.</Warning>
