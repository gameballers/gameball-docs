Knowing how Huawei requires its own setup if we want to connect with their systems, Gameball now enables you to setup this connection in few steps to enable **Huawei push notifications**.

## How does it work?

When sending notifications, the system will detect if a user has a **Huawei device** and send the push notification via **Huawei's push service (HMS - Huawei Mobile Services)** instead of Firebase (FCM).

<Note>If a customer has both **Google Play and Huawei services**, prioritize Firebase.</Note>

## What are the requirements for a successful setup?

You must provide the following Huawei credentials in the Gameball dashboard:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

## How to get Huawei App Client ID & Secret?

- In the **App information** area displayed, view the app information, and you will fing client ID, and client secret.
