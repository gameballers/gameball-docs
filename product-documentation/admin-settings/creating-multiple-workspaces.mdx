## Creating Multiple Workspaces for Different Program Configurations

**Platform**

**Plan**

Non-platform only (Not available on Shopify or Salla)

Upon request

<Warning>
**Important Disclaimer:** This feature is only available upon request on non-platforms only. Please get in touch with our customer support team. (not available on Shopify and Salla)
</Warning>

Understanding how you would want to deploy entirely different loyalty and marketing programs for each platform, branch, or area your brand is in, we have created the **Workspaces** feature.

Workspaces allow you to create an entirely different program with different configurations and program calculations so that it suits customers who could be from different countries or accustomed to different loyalty systems in certain branches.

For example, if your brand is deployed in different countries, such as the US and Japan, you can create entirely different loyalty programs for each of the countries. This way, customers from the USA and Japan will each enjoy different rewards and communications.

When you create a new workspace under your account, you will be given access to an entirely new and clean dashboard that is awaiting your configurations and activation.

After contacting Gameball's support team and having this feature activated, you will be able to create a new workspace by following these steps:

<Warning>
**Important Note:** If your account has any user role other than **Owner**, you can not create a new workspace. Please refer back to the account owner to create a new workspace. [Learn more](/product-documentation/admin-settings/create-user-assign-roles)

## How to create a new workspace

- Go to **Gameball Dashboard**, under the Gameball logo, you will find the workspace name you have. Click on the **current workspace name,** then **Create new workspace**

- Click **Create**.

You will be taken to a new dashboard with no data in it, so you can start creating your programs from scratch.

- To navigate between workspaces, under the Gameball logo, you will find the name of the new workspace you have created. Click on it then you will find all workspaces. Choose the workspace you wish to access.

<Warning>
**Important Note:** if your account has any user role other than **Owner**, then you will only see workspaces that you are given access to by the **Owner**. Other workspaces will be hidden. Please refer back to the owner to request access to other workspaces. [Learn more](/product-documentation/admin-settings/create-user-assign-roles)
