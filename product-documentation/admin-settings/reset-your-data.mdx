## How to Reset Your Data on Gameball

**All Gameball customers**

---

If you want to reset some or all your data related to your loyalty program, Gameball allows you to do that through a few, easy steps.

## There are two types of data you can reset on Gameball:

- **All Customers data:** resets all information related to customers only, such as customers' points, levels, scores, achievements, activities, transactions, and all corresponding information. Learn more about [customer's data](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/gameball-customers/introduction-to-customers-on-gameball)

  **The below customer data will be deleted without retrieval:**

  - All existing customers' data, on both live and test versions (achievements, transactions, score, points, activities, and all corresponding information).
  - All program achievements.
  - All points redemptions or transactions.
  - All messages sending and clicking activities.

  <Warning>
    **Note:** before resetting customers' data, you might want to consider backing up this data by extracting it as a CSV file. To learn more, read Step 2 of [importing customers' data](/product-documentation/guides-strategies-faqs/supportive-guides/import-customers-csv).
  </Warning>

- **All Data:** Reset all previous configurations related to your Gameball account and widget, including customers' data will be permanently deleted.

  Once you reset all your data, you will start with the configuration wizard from the beginning with a fresh new version of Gameball.

<Warning>
**Note:** Remember that all your data and configurations will be removed without retrieval.
