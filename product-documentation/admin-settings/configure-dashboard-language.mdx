Gameball currently supports nine languages on the dashboard to enable clients to use their local language while setting up their player experience. Now, you can choose between the following languages:

- English (EN)
- Arabic (AR)
- French (FR)
- Japanese (JA)
- Español (ES)
- Italiano (IT)
- Português (Brasil)
- Português (Portugal)
- Deutsch (DE)

By default, your dashboard language is English (EN), however, you can easily change that by following these steps:

1. Login to your Gameball dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **General**.
3. In the **Admin Dashboard Language**, click on **Edit** Icon.
4. Choose your preferred language from the dropdown menu then click **Save**.
5. Watch your dashboard change its previous language to the selected language.

We are currently working on localizing our dashboard to more languages. If you would like to suggest a new language, please email us at [support@gameball.co](mailto:support@gameball.co)
