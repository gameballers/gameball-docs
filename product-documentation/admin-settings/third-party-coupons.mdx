- You will receive an email notification confirming whether the upload was successful or not.

### 3. Manage Coupon Inventory

- Go to the **Coupon Inventory** tab to view all uploaded third-party coupons.
- The table displays each coupon along with its status:
  - **Available**: The coupon has not yet been claimed by any customer.
  - **Used**: The coupon has already been redeemed.

### 4. Track Coupon Redemption

- Gameball automatically marks a coupon as **Used** once it is claimed by a customer.
- You can track redemption statuses directly from the dashboard.

<Note>
**Important Notes:**

- Ensure your CSV file is correctly formatted to avoid upload issues.
- Only users with the appropriate permission levels can manage coupons.
</Note>

## Common Questions:

- **What happens if I upload duplicate coupon codes?**

  - The system will reject duplicates during validation and notify you via email.

- **Can I reuse a coupon code that has been marked as Used?**
  - No, once a coupon is used, it cannot be reassigned or reused.
