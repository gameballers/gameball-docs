Available for all Gameball customers except for free packages

Placeholder variable text is used to add personalized data on each customer to your email notifications. Variables appearing in the email notifications preview are automatically replaced with actual data. So when the actual email notification is sent to your customers, the actual data appears instead of the variable placed.

Starting with a quick overview of variables. A variable is a value that can change depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. It is simply a name that can be replaced with a real value from computer memory.

To use a variable in an email, click **Merge Tags** and select your variable.
