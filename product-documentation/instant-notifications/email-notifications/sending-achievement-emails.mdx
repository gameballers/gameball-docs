Enable the email notifications feature to send your customers emails every time they earn cashback, points, or complete reward campaigns on your platform.

Sometimes, customers earn points or win reward campaigns while they are not on your platform, for example, if their sign up anniversary or birthday, your customers will earn a reward on a specified day without any recent interaction on your platform from their side. This is where email notifications can be very useful. Enabling email notifications can help you drive back your customers to visit your platform.

<Note>
Customers who do not want to keep receiving your emails can easily unsubscribe through a small hyperlink at the bottom of every Gameball email.
</Note>

## Where to Find the Email Notification Section

On the **Gameball Dashboard**. From the left bar, click **Notifications**, then select **Emails**.

## Sending Test Emails

Before activating your customer email notifications, you can send a test email to yourself (Logged in user) to see a preview of the email that will be sent to your customers. To do so, click **Send Test Email**.

## Activating Email Notifications

To activate any of your customer email notifications, all mandatory fields must be filled first. So for templates you have configured, tested, and are ready to be activated, go to the tab of the same type of emails and switch the toggle to **Active**.

You can enable or disable the notification through the **Active Toggle**.

## Common Questions:

#### Can I remove the "Powered by Gameball" from the email footer?

No, at Gameball, we follow international email regulations like the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act and Canada's CASL. These laws require that all promotional or automated emails include clear sender information and an unsubscribe option. This is why that section of the email footer is fixed; it is there to protect both you and your customers and to ensure that all emails sent through Gameball remain compliant.
