Available for all Gameball customers except for free packages

If you want your customers to engage with your [preset reward campaigns](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/introduction-rewards-campaigns), make sure to create automated real-time notifications to inform them when the campaign is unlocked, or achieved, or when you want to motivate them to keep going mid-way.

There are two portals to create a real-time notification for when a reward campaign is achieved:

1. The Global Real-time Notification section on the dashboard.
2. Create a different notification for each [reward campaign](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/introduction-rewards-campaigns) via the internal reward campaign settings.

This article will walk you through how to create a notification through each of the two methods. Follow the steps below to activate real-time notifications for adding or deducting points.

## How to Create Real-Time Notifications for When a Reward is Achieved

You can access the notifications' global settings in the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**.

- From the left bar, Click **Notifications.**
- Choose between **In-App, Emails, & SMS.**
- Scroll to **Reward Campaigns,** and select between **Unlocked, Motivate Customers,** and **Achieved.**

Start writing the message itself. Construct a heading and a body for the notification. In case you are creating an email notification, write a clear subject line and body.

## Script Updates for Reward Campaigns Notifications

You can add the transaction notifications script for all notifications through this page:

### 1. Unlocked Message

Send real-time notifications when a customer has a new reward unlocked. This way they notice that there is a possibility to enroll in a new campaign and win a reward when completed.

### 2. Motivate Customers Message

Make sure your customers keep going and are proceeding with the required steps to complete the reward requirements and achieve their final goal by sending them a motivational message informing them that they are steps closer to winning.

### 3. Achieved Message

Send a real-time notification when your customer completes all the requirements of the reward campaign. Inform them of their achievement, and the reward they have earned as a result.

### 4. Preview and Change Notification Icon

Before activating the notification, you might need to take a look at what the notification will look like for customers. You can easily do so by clicking **Preview** on the top right of the edit page.

## Creating a Notification Only For a Specific Reward Campaign

In the [reward campaign](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/introduction-rewards-campaigns) creation process in **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, you can add a custom script to be sent for this reward campaign specifically and only and bypass the global settings:

To create a reward campaign from scratch follow the steps in this [article](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/create-action-based-reward-campaign).

While creating a new reward campaign, you will come across the **Notifications**. Choose if you want to edit an **In-app Notification**, or an **Email Notification**, or both by clicking on **Edit**.

<Frame>
![Reward campaign notification edit](/images/product-docs/instant-notifications/real-time-notifications-per-program/reward-campaign-notification-edit.png)
</Frame>

Select between:

**Global Settings**: This will follow the reward campaign notification created and activated through the main notification section.

**On:** This will allow you to create your own message by writing a different **Head** and **Body** for the notification as shown below.

**Off:** This will not allow your customer to receive a notification upon achieving this reward campaign.
