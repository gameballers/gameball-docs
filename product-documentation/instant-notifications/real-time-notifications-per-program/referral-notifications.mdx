Available for all Gameball customers except for free packages

When a customer refers a friend they will want to know if their referral was completed. It is important to notify your customer instantaneously with a message that tells them their referral was successful. You might also want to send them if they receive a reward for that successful referral.

Follow the steps below to activate real-time notifications for successful referrals.

## How to Create Real-Time Notifications for Referrals

You can access the notifications' global settings in the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**.

- From the left bar, Click **Notifications.**
- Choose between **In-App, Emails, & SMS.**
- Scroll to **Referrals,** and select between **Successful Referral** and **Referred Friend Achievement.**

Start writing the message itself. Construct a heading and a body for the notification. In case you are creating an email notification, write a clear subject line and body.

## Script Updates for Referral Notifications

You can add the transaction notifications script for all notifications through this page:

### 1. Successful Referral Message

Send real-time transaction notifications for every successful referral. Inform your customer when the friend they referred has completed the required action.

### 2. Referred Friend Achievement Message

If you reward your customers when their referral attempt becomes successful, then ensure that your customer receives a real-time notification informing them that they have received an award due to their successful referral attempt.
