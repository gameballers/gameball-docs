Available for all Gameball customers except for free packages

When a customer redeems points or has some points refunded, or when points or coupons are soon to expire, you will need to inform your customer how many points were redeemed, refunded, or about to expire, and what their current points balance is. Follow the steps below to activate real-time notifications for different transactional rewards cases.

## How to Create Real-Time Notifications for Transactional Rewards

You can access the notifications' global settings in the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**.

- From the left bar, Click **Notifications.**
- Choose between **In-App, Emails, & SMS.**
- Scroll to **Rewards,** and select between **Points Redemption**, **Points Refund**, **Points Expiry Reminder**, and **Coupon Expiry Reminder.** In case it is an email notification, you can also choose to create a notification for **Coupon Earned**.
