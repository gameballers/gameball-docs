Available for all Gameball customers except for free packages

When a customer earns points for completing a purchase they might earn some points back as cashback. It is important to notify your customers instantaneously with a message that informs them of the amount of points they have received for that transaction.

The same applies in case points were revoked for a cancellation or a refund. Inform the customer of the canceled cashback points and let them know their current points balance. Follow the steps below to activate real-time notifications for cashback transactions.

## How to Create Real-Time Notifications for Cashback

You can access the notifications' global settings in the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**.

- From the left bar, Click **Notifications.**
- Choose between **In-App, Emails, & SMS.**
- Scroll to **Cashback,** and select between **Cashback Rewards** or **Cashback Cancelled.**

Start writing the message itself. Construct a heading and a body for the notification. In case you are creating an email notification, write a clear subject line and body.

## Script Update for Cashback Notifications

You can add the transaction notifications script for all notifications through this page:

### 2. Cashback Cancelled
