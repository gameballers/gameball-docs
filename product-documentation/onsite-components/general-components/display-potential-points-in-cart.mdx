With Gameball's potential points display, customers can instantly see the rewards they'll earn for their cart items before completing their purchase. This engaging feature highlights the value of each purchase, motivating customers to check out and start earning points.

**Benefits:**

- **Increase average order value**: Customers are more likely to add additional items to their cart when they see the direct rewards tied to each product, leading to increased spending.
- **Reduce cart abandonment:** Motivate customers to complete the purchase by showing the reward they will get by completing their purchase.

- **Guest Customers**: If the customer isn't logged in, the block will show the potential points they can earn based on default "earn points" rules, ignoring any custom order reward per tier.
