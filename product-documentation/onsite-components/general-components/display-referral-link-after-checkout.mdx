After a customer places an order, it's the perfect time to engage with them while their excitement is at its peak. By introducing your referral program at this moment, you can turn a positive purchase experience into an opportunity for organic growth.

Gameball now offers a referral block that appears once an order is completed, highlighting the reward customers can earn by referring friends and providing their unique referral link.

**Benefits:**

1. **Encourage immediate sharing:** Displaying the referral prompt right after an order is completed taps into the customer's post-purchase enthusiasm, increasing the likelihood of referrals.
2. **Boost customer acquisition:** Leveraging recent buyers' excitement can lead to more personal recommendations, attracting high-quality new customers through word-of-mouth.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Updated Theme">
    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## Logged-In vs. Guest (Not-Logged-In) Customers

- **Not Logged-In Customers**: If you are not logged in, the extension will prompt you to log in or register to be able to refer your friends and earn the referral reward.

- **Logged-In Customers:** When the logged-in customer reaches the thank you page after placing an order, the extension will be displayed, allowing the customer to copy their referral link and share it with their friends.
