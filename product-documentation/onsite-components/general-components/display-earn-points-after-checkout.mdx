Displaying the number of earned points on the Thank You page is an important way to keep customers engaged and informed about their loyalty rewards. In addition to showing the points, this block includes a call-to-action (CTA) labeled **"Check Ways to Redeem."** This CTA opens up all available redemption options, making it easy for customers to explore how they can use their points and encouraging them to return for future purchases.

**Benefits:**

- **Increases Loyalty Program Awareness:** By showcasing earned points and offering clear redemption options, customers are reminded of the value of the loyalty program, strengthening their connection with the brand.
- **Encourages Repeat Purchases:** Seeing how many points they've earned motivates customers to come back and redeem their rewards, which drives repeat purchases and enhances customer retention.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
