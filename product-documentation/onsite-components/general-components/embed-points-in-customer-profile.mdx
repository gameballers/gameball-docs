## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Classic Customer Accounts">
    Ensure you're using Shopify's Classic customer accounts. The new customer accounts don't support third-party apps yet. However, when you are adding the "Account Balance" embedded block, it is only supported by the old account creation method (classic account). This is due to a limitation from Shopify, as they don't allow third-party apps like Gameball to edit the page with the new method.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Updated Shopify Theme">
    Your theme must support app blocks. Without this, the Gameball block will not be visible in the editor. [Learn More](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I display the Points Balance block elsewhere on my website?">
    Currently, the block can only be embedded on the customer account page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this block work with Shopify's New Customer Accounts?">
    Gameball supports the "New customer account creation" in the following way: When a user logs in using Email/OTP and Gameball identifies their Shopify account, they are created as a member in Gameball (instead of a guest). This change resolves issues such as users not receiving rewards from birthdays, social campaigns, streaks, and similar benefits.

    However, if you are adding the "Account Balance" embedded block, it is only supported by the old account creation method. This is due to a limitation from Shopify, as they don't allow third-party apps like Gameball to edit the page with the new method.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Why am I seeing an error message after clicking "Customize"?'>
    If you encounter a "There is a problem loading the page" message, review the prerequisites to ensure all conditions are met. If the issue persists, contact us at [support@gameball.co](mailto:support@gameball.co).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I downgrade to the Free plan?">
    The Points Balance block will automatically hide if your plan doesn't support this feature.
