The product page plays a crucial role in the customer journey. By integrating loyalty features directly into your product pages, you increase touchpoints for engagement, which can lead to higher sales.

Gameball allows users to display potential points that can be earned directly on the product page. This feature gives customers clear visibility into the rewards they'll earn for each purchase, encouraging engagement and driving higher conversion rates by showcasing the benefits of their loyalty program upfront.

**Benefits:**

- **Encourage customers to add products to the cart:** Highlighting potential points motivates customers to add items to their cart, increasing purchase likelihood.
- **Drive higher average order value**: Customers are more likely to add additional items to their cart when they see the direct rewards tied to each product, leading to increased spending.
