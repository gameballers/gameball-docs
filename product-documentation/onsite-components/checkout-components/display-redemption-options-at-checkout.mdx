## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shopify Plus">
    This feature is exclusively available to merchants on the **Shopify Plus** plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Updated Shopify Theme">
    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## How it Works

- **Guest (Not Logged-In) Customers:** For customers who are not logged in, the extension will prompt them to sign in to access their points balance and redeem rewards. Without logging in, you won't be able to view or use your points at checkout.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product-docs/onsite-components/checkout-redeem-dropdown-guest.png" alt="Guest customer redeem dropdown view" />
  </Frame>

- **Logged-In Customers**: When a logged-in customer reaches the checkout page, the extension will automatically display, allowing them to view their points balance and choose a reward in exchange for points.

  <Frame>

  </Frame>

- **Redeeming Points**: After selecting a reward and entering the desired number of points, the customer clicks **'Redeem'**. Gameball will then deduct the points from the customer's balance and automatically generate a discount code, which will be applied to the order.

  </Frame>

- **Error Handling**: If the discount code cannot be applied due to specific conditions (e.g., minimum order value not met, restrictions on combining discounts, or other advanced rules), an error message will appear, explaining why the coupon cannot be used with the current cart.

## Customization

### Style Customization

The checkout extensions have no style customization options. However, you can customize its position by simply dragging and dropping it to your desired location on the checkout page.

### Content & Translation

In the Gameball Dashboard, go to **Widget > Content**. Under the **Onsite** tab, edit the text and customize it for supported languages.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the customer redeems points but doesn't use the coupon?">
    If the customer redeems points but does not use the generated coupon immediately, they can access the coupon later through the widget. The coupon will remain available for future use, but it cannot be reverted to points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I downgrade my plan?">
    The dropdown will automatically hide if your plan no longer supports the feature.
