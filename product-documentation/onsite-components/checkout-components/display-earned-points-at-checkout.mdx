Displaying the potential points customers can earn from their order on the checkout page helps them understand the immediate rewards they'll receive. By showing how many points they will earn with their purchase, this feature encourages customers to make the most of their loyalty program benefits right at the point of transaction.

**Benefits:**

- **Increases Order Value:** Showing potential points encourages customers to add more items to their cart to maximize their rewards, leading to higher average order value.
- **Boosts Loyalty Program Engagement:** By highlighting the rewards they'll earn, customers are more likely to engage with the loyalty program and make repeat purchases to accumulate more points.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shopify Plus">
    This feature is exclusively available to merchants on the **Shopify Plus** plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Updated Shopify Theme">
    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## How it Works

- **Guest Customers**: If not logged in, the extension will show the earned points in addition to asking you to log in to collect the points.

  </Frame>

- **Logged-In Customers:** When the logged-in customer reaches the checkout page after placing an order, the extension will be displayed, showing the number of points earned from the last order, in addition to a call-to-action that opens the widget on the redemption option to let the user redeem their points.

## Customization

### Style Customization

The checkout extensions have no style customization options. However, you can customize its position by simply dragging and dropping it to your desired location on the checkout page.

### Content & Translation

In the Gameball Dashboard, go to **Widget > Content**. Under the **Onsite** tab, edit the text and customize it for supported languages.
