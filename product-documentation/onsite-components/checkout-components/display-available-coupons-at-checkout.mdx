At checkout, customers can now easily apply their available rewards or discounts through a convenient dropdown menu. This streamlined process enhances the checkout experience, making it quick and simple for customers to redeem their loyalty rewards.

**Benefits:**

- **Simplified Redemption Process:** The dropdown menu makes it easy for customers to view and apply their available rewards, reducing friction and speeding up the checkout.
- **Increased Reward Utilization:** By presenting all available rewards upfront, customers are more likely to redeem their points, boosting loyalty program engagement.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shopify Plus">
    This feature is exclusively available to merchants on the **Shopify Plus** plan.

    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## How It Works

- **Not Logged-In Customers:** If you are not logged in, the extension will prompt you to log in to view your available rewards.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product-docs/onsite-components/checkout-coupons-guest.png" alt="Guest customer coupons view" />
  </Frame>

- **Logged-In Customers:** When the logged-in customer reaches the checkout page, the extension will be displayed, allowing them to select from their available rewards.

  </Frame>

- **Applying Rewards:** Once the customer clicks **'Apply'**, Gameball will automatically apply the discount to their order.

  </Frame>

- **Error Handling:** If the coupon is not applicable due to conditions like minimum order value, restrictions on combining with other discounts, or other advanced conditions, an error message will appear explaining why the coupon cannot be applied to the cart.

## Customization

The checkout extensions have no style customization options. However, you can customize its position by simply dragging and dropping it to your desired location on the checkout page.

### Content & Translation

In the Gameball Dashboard, go to **Widget > Content**. Under the **Onsite** tab, edit the text and customize it for supported languages.
