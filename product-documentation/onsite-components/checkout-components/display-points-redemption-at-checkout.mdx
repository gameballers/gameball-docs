Offering customers the ability to redeem loyalty points at checkout is a powerful way to enhance their shopping experience and strengthen their connection with your brand. With Gameball's new feature, users can now view their points balance directly during checkout and easily redeem them for discounts by entering the number of points they want to use.

**Benefits:**

- **Simplify Redemption:** Providing a direct input field for point redemption at checkout makes it easier for users to apply their rewards, reducing friction.
- **Increase Reward Utilization:** Displaying the redeem option at checkout encourages customers to use their points, leading to higher reward usage and satisfaction.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shopify Plus">
    This feature is exclusively available to merchants on the **Shopify Plus** plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Updated Shopify Theme">
    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

  </Step>
  <Step title='Activate the "Flexible Redemption Option"'>
    Ensure that the "Flexible Redemption Option" is activated and configured with the right values.

    In the Gameball dashboard, make sure the toggle at the top-right is activated. Once this is enabled, you'll be able to add the Gameball block.

## How it Works

### Guest Customers

- If not logged in, customers will see a login prompt to access their balance.
- Once identified (email entered), the block updates to the logged-in version.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/onsite-components/checkout-redeem-input-guest.png" alt="Guest customer redeem input view" />
</Frame>

### Logged-In Customers

- The block displays the total available points as a default in the input field.
- Customers can enter the desired amount to redeem.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/onsite-components/checkout-redeem-input-logged-in.png" alt="Logged-in customer redeem input view" />
</Frame>

- After adding the points, the customer clicks on **"Redeem"**, and Gameball will deduct points from the customer's balance and automatically generate a discount code, which is then applied to the order.

<Frame>

</Frame>

- **Error Handling**: If the coupon is not applicable due to conditions like minimum order value, restrictions on combining with other discounts, or other advanced conditions, an error message will appear explaining why the coupon cannot be applied to the cart.

## Customization

### Style Customization

The checkout extensions have no style customization options. However, you can customize its position by simply dragging and dropping it to your desired location on the checkout page.

### Content & Translation

In the Gameball Dashboard, go to **Widget > Content**. Under the **Onsite** tab, edit the text and customize it for supported languages.
