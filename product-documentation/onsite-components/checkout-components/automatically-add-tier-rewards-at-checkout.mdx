<Steps>
  <Step title="Shopify Plus">
    This feature is exclusively available to merchants on the **Shopify Plus** plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Updated Shopify Theme">
    Your Shopify theme must support app blocks. Without this, the option to add the Gameball block won't appear in the editor. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gameball Embed Block">
    Go to the **Theme Editor** in your Shopify admin. Select **App Embeds** from the left menu, search for "Gameball," and toggle it on.

## How It Works

- **Logged-In Customers:** When a logged-in customer reaches the checkout page, the extension will automatically apply a discount if the customer is part of a tier that qualifies for a lifetime reward.

  </Frame>

- If the discount cannot be applied due to conditions such as meeting a minimum order value, restrictions on combining discounts, or other advanced rules, an error message will appear explaining why the coupon cannot be used for the current cart.

  </Frame>

- **Non-Logged-In (Guest) Customers:**
  - Non-logged-in customers will not be able to receive a discount until they log in and become eligible for a tier with a lifetime reward.
  - Once logged in, the same rules for applicable discounts will apply, including any restrictions that may prevent the coupon from being used.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
This extension will automatically not work if:

- The Gameball program is deactivated.
