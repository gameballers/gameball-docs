## Promote Product Cross-Sell

Capitalize on recent purchases by suggesting complementary products to customers. When a customer buys Product X, this automation starts. After a day, we send them an email suggesting related products they might like, based on their purchase. This personalized approach improves their shopping experience and could boost sales by showing them items they're interested in.
