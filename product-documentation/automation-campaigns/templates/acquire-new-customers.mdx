## Welcome Series Template

### Goal

Encourage new customers to complete their first purchase by giving them a surprise gift -- a 20% discount -- when they create an account.

### Flow

They receive an email about the discount right away, and if they don't make a purchase within 3 days, they get a reminder email encouraging them to take advantage of the discount.

### Trigger

Account Created

### Instructions

<Warning>
  - Avoid using the "Create Account" challenge with this automation to prevent customers from earning rewards twice.
  - Make sure to disable any other welcome email upon account creation to prevent duplicate emails from being sent.
</Warning>

## Ask Repeated Customers for Referrals Template

### Goal

Encourage loyal customers (those with more than 2 orders) to refer their friends after making a purchase.

### Flow

This automation triggers when a customer places an order and waits for 14 days. It then sends an email inviting the customer to refer a friend and earn rewards. If no successful referrals are received within 2 days, a reminder email is sent.

### Trigger

Placed Order

### Instructions

<Note>
  - Enable the referral program and set up rewards for both your customers and their friends.
  - Ensure that you activate the notification emails for both the customer and their friend upon successful referral.
  - Adjust the 14-day wait to match your process. It's set to ensure that the customer received the order; change it if needed.
