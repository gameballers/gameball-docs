Automation Campaigns in Gameball serve as an indispensable tool, designed to streamline essential and repetitive customer-related tasks, thereby eliminating manual interventions and boosting overall efficiency. By leveraging automation, you can establish seamless processes and enhance productivity significantly.

## Understanding Gameball Automation Campaigns

Gameball Automation empowers you to create a series of predefined actions triggered by specific events, thus automating routine tasks effectively.

### How Gameball Automation Campaigns Work

Creating an automated workflow involves defining **three** fundamental components:

1. **Triggers**: These are the criteria that initiate the workflow. Once the trigger conditions are met, Gameball initiates the predetermined sequence of actions. [Learn more about triggers](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/automation-triggers).

2. **Actions**: These are the commands executed by Gameball once the trigger conditions are met. Actions can include sending customized messages and emails and granting rewards, etc. [Learn more about actions](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/automation-actions).

3. **Control**: This component allows you to set conditions that must be met before subsequent actions in the workflow are executed. [Learn more about controls](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/automation-controls).
