    ### Generate Gameball referral dynamic links and complete the referral experience on mobile

    This is required if you plan to use the Referral Program.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Customer Events to Gameball">
    You can track actions your customers take as Customer Events, while logged into your platform only. Sending events will be through the [Send actions (events) API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/events#post-send-events).

    You can use these customer events in the below:

    - Create action-based campaigns and rewards. [Read about the events creation engine](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/faqs/using-the-event-engine).
    - Create referral campaigns and rewards. [Read about the referral program](/product-documentation/programs/referral-program/launching-referral-program).
    - Send customer messages based on events. [Read about how to create and configure your customer messages](/product-documentation/communication-campaigns/introduction-to-communication-campaigns).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Referral Integration">
    <Note>
    If you are not going to use the referral program, skip this step.
    </Note>

    Gameball can reward your customers for referring their friends to join your platform. [Read about the Referral Program](/product-documentation/programs/referral-program/launching-referral-program).

    You should follow the integration steps based on your mobile app:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="iOS">
        Follow the [iOS referrals module guide](https://docs.gameball.co/installing-gameball/gameball-for-ios/referrals-module-on-ios).
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Android">
        Follow the [Android referrals module guide](https://developer.gameball.co/installing-gameball/android/referrals-module).
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="React Native">
        Follow the [React Native referrals module guide](https://docs.gameball.co/installing-gameball/gameball-for-react/referrals-module-on-react-native).
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reward your customers based on the paid amount through the Cashback Program">
    Through the cashback program, for every paid placed order on your mobile app using cash, credit card, PayPal, etc., you can reward your customers **with points** based on a predefined equation. Follow the steps below to complete the integration:

    1. Configure the reward equation on the Gameball Admin Dashboard. [Read about the Points earn and redeem settings](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-earn/launch-and-configure-your-earn-pointing-system).

    <Note>
    The program must be **Active**.
    </Note>

    2. On every successful paid placed order on your mobile app, use the [Cashback API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions#post-reward-cashback) to update Gameball.

    <Warning>
    It is recommended to send the Cashback API call when the order status is completely paid. In case the payment method, for example, is COD (Cash on delivery), you should send the API call when the customer actually pays the order amount.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
