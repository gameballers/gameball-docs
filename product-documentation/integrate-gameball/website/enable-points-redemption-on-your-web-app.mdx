Through Gameball, you can allow your customers to transform and use their collected points as discount coupons on their customer widget through your web app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable points redemption on your web app">
    Configure the redemption equation on the Gameball Admin Dashboard. [Read about the Points earn and redeem settings](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-earn/launch-and-configure-your-earn-pointing-system).

    <Note>
    Points redemption status must be **Active**.
    </Note>

    Follow the steps below to complete the points transaction:

    1. You can get the current customer balance to check if there is sufficient balance or not, or if you want to show it to your customer on your web app through the [Customer Points Balance API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-balance).
    2. Start a points hold request through the [Hold Points API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/transactions/hold-management#post-hold-points).
       This API will hold the requested amount for 10 minutes until your customer completes the payment process on your web app using any other payment method, in case it is a partial payment using points.
    3. The order is placed and paid successfully on your website.
    4. Totally redeem the held points from the customer balance through the [Redeem Points API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions#post-redeem).
  </Step>
