1. Set how the coupon will be applied: Choose between Discount Code or Automatic
   - **Discount Code:** A code that you will share with your customers that they will use while checking out
   - **Automatic:** Once the customer meets, a discount will be applied automatically
2. **Internal Name the Coupon**: Provide a unique name for your coupon for better monitoring on the dashboard.
3. **Set the Coupon Code**: You can manually enter a code or allow Gameball to auto-generate it.
4. **External Name:** Customers can see the **localized display name** in their widget, emails, and web messages.
5. **Terms & Conditions:** Add localized Terms & Conditions for manual coupons, helping you clearly communicate coupon rules and usage limits to customers in their preferred language.

7. **Set the Minimum Purchase Amount:** Define the minimum amount required for the coupon to apply.
8. **Apply the Coupon**: Decide whether it applies to **All Orders** or **Specific Collections**.

#### How to distinguish regular coupons from automatic promotions?

We've enhanced the **Customer Coupons API** to make it easier for apps and storefronts to distinguish **automatic promotions** from **regular coupons** and to display the **promotion rules** that define how customers can qualify for each offer. Here is what you will find:

- Gameball added a new boolean flag: `"isPromotion": true`
  - `isPromotion = false` → Regular or manually issued coupon.
  - `isPromotion = true` → Promotion or rule-based discount (e.g., "Buy 2 Get 1 Free", "50% Off Collection").

- Added a new object for **promotion details**:

```json
"promotionRules": {
  "type": "Buy X Get Y",
  "description": "Buy 2 items from Summer Collection, get 1 free T-shirt",
  "conditions": {
    "buyQuantity": 2,
    "getQuantity": 1,
    "applicableCollections": ["Summer Collection"],
    "minOrderValue": 0
  }
}
```

Includes:
- Promotion type and description
- Applicable collections or products
- Minimum order value or eligibility rules

### Step 3: Choose the Audience

Select the target audience for the coupon:

- **All Customers**: The coupon will be accessible to all customers.
- **Specific Customers**: Target specific customer groups with precision using these options:
  - **Segments**: Based on predefined customer behaviors.
  - **RFM Segments**: Utilize Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
  - **Tags**: Assign tags to filter customers.
  - **Customer Attributes**: Filter customers based on attributes such as:
    - **Customer ID**
    - **Customer Email**

### Step 4: Configure Advanced Options (if needed)

Add optional configurations to customize the coupon further:

- **Start Date**: Specify when the coupon will become active.
- **End Date:** Specify when the coupon will expire.

<Frame>

</Frame>

- **Expiry Date**: Set an end date for the coupon.
- **Coupon Usage Per Customer Limit**: Set how many times an individual customer can use the coupon.
- **Coupon Usage Limit**: Establish a total usage cap for the coupon.
- **Reward Combined with Other Coupons**: Specify whether the coupon can be used alongside other offers.

### Step 5: Save the Coupon

Once all details have been added, click the **Save** button to finalize your coupon.
