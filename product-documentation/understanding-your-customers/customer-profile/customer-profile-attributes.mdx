---

Gameball provides one of its most powerful features for personalization -- Customer Attributes. With these attributes, you can enrich each customer profile, store custom data, and create highly targeted campaigns using specific notifications, messages, or emails based on segmented customer groups.

There are three types of customer attributes supported by Gameball:

- **Default Attributes**: Predefined by Gameball and expected to be sent by your platform.
- **Calculated Attributes**: Automatically generated and updated by Gameball.
- **Custom Attributes**: Attributes that you define based on your specific business needs.

## Default Customer Attributes

These are attributes expected to be sent from your platform to Gameball using API or integration methods. They help form the base of every customer profile.

If you are using Gameball on a supported platform such as **Shopify** or **Salla**, some of these attributes are already included by default through Gameball's plugin integration.

### 1. Attributes Sent Through API or Platform Integration

These attributes should be provided through your system via Gameball's API or are automatically included when using a native integration with platforms like **Shopify** or **Salla**.

### 2. Attributes Captured Automatically by Gameball

These attributes do **not** need to be sent from your system. Gameball captures them automatically or when the **Gameball widget** is active on your website.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gameball Creation Date** | The date the customer profile was created in Gameball | Captured automatically when a new customer profile is created |

## Adding Custom Attributes to Customer Profiles

Need to store additional details like region, area, or membership ID? You can create **custom attributes** to capture unique data specific to your business.

These attributes can be used for segmentation, automation, and personalizing campaigns across Gameball modules. To add custom attributes:

- Define your custom fields via the API
- Assign values to these fields per customer
- Use these values to segment your customers

Custom attributes give you full control over what kind of data to track and how to act on it.
