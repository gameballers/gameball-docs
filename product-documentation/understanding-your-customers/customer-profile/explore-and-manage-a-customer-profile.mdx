## Profile Overview

You can access the profile of any customer by navigating to **Customers**, then clicking the name or ID of any listed customer. The profile is divided into several key sections:

### 1. Info & Details

You can view essential customer information grouped into the following areas:

**Info Panel**

- Includes identity and contact details such as name, email, mobile number, location, and customer status (e.g., guest or registered).
- Displays unique attributes and behavioral indicators such as UTMs and devices used.
- Shows whether the customer is subscribed to your emails and their preferred language.

### 2. Referrals

This panel includes:

- The customer's unique **referral link**
- Who referred them (if any)
- A list of customers they have referred

### 4. Segments & Tags

### 7. Reward Campaigns History

This section lists all the campaigns the customer has completed or participated in. For each campaign, you can:

- View the name and type of campaign
- See how many times it was completed
- Identify which are completed vs. in-progress

### 8. Communication Activities

- See message type icons (email, in-app, etc.) and key dates like **Sent** and **Clicked** at a glance.
- Cards are sorted by **newest first**, with a **Load More** option for long histories.
- When empty, you will see: *"No Communication Activities Yet."*

### 9. Automation Activities

- Each automation now displays its **name**, **status (Completed, Waiting, or Exited)**, and key dates (Entry, Complete, or Exit).
- Compact one-line view for simple automations.
- When empty, you will see: *"No Active Automations."*

Clicking a campaign name will redirect you to its configuration page.
