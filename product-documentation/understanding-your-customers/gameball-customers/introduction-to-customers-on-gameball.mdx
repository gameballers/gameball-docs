When your customer is interacting with your platform through Gameball, they go through a gamified experience that helps boost engagement and retention. As they continue to engage with your platform, customers can earn points, achieve milestones, and progress through VIP tiers.

Gameball automatically creates a profile for every new customer. This profile stores and displays their progress, achievements, point transactions, and all relevant customer activities. You can track all these details through the Gameball dashboard.

## What Every Customer Has

### VIP Tier

Customers start their journey at a specific **VIP tier** and can advance to higher tiers based on the engagement metrics you define. You can choose to measure progress through points, score, or other variables. Gameball allows you to monitor this journey in real-time through the **Gameball dashboard**.

### Points

Points are granted to customers for placing orders or completing specific actions/achievements. These points can be redeemed for discounts, benefits, or other rewards that you configure. The more transactions or actions a customer completes, the more points they accumulate.

By default, Gameball will create a profile for every customer, and then you will be able to track their progress, achievements, and points transactions through the Gameball admin dashboard.

### Customer Profile Attributes

Gameball allows you to enrich customer profiles with custom attributes such as name, gender, join date, birthday, and more. These attributes are used in personalized communication, segmentation, and automation across Gameball modules.

### Customer Events

Events are any actions performed by your customers on your platform, such as viewing products, adding to the cart, placing an order, etc. You can trigger rewards, segment, or send a campaign to your customers based on these events.

### Customer Segments

Customers can belong to different segments depending on how they are categorized. These can include tags added manually to the customer profile, dynamic segments based on predefined rules configured by you, or automatically generated RFM segments that consider recency, frequency, and monetary value. These segments can be used to define targeted audiences across all Gameball modules, including campaigns, automation, and redemption options.
