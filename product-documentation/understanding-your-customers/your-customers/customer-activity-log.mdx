The **Customer Activities** tab logs all tracked actions made by your customers.

### Understand the Columns in the Activities List

Each record includes:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | The timestamp of the recorded activity. |
| **Customer** | Displays the customer's Gameball ID and full name (if available). |
| **Activity** | The activity type that was logged (see full list below). |
| **Points** | Reflects the number of points earned or deducted, if applicable. In case points are pending, you will see a clock icon beside the activity points -- hover over it to see when it will be activated. Hovering over the points amount will allow you to see their expiration date. |
| **Coupons** | Shows the coupon type and value if one was issued or redeemed as part of the activity. |
| **Merchant** | Reserved for multi-merchant activities. It shows the merchant name that owns this activity and the corresponding branch name. This is available only in case the [Merchant Module](/product-documentation/merchants/gameball-merchants-crossover-rewards) was used by this account. The Merchant Module is only available for non-platform integration with Gameball. |
