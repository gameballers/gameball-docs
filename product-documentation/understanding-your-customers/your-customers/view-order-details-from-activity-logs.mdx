Gameball allows you to track all order-related interactions through the **Customers Activities** tab. When a customer completes a transaction, redeems a cashback, or receives a refund, Gameball logs the event and links it to the associated order.

## Accessing Order Details

When an activity is linked to an order (e.g., cashback reward or refund), the **order ID** will appear as a clickable value directly within the activity log.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Activities">
    Go to **Customers > Activities**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find an order-related activity">
    Locate any activity associated with an order (e.g., **Cashback Rewarded**, **Points Refunded**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the order ID">
    Click the **order ID** shown on the second line of the activity. This will open a side tab with full order details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Refund Details

If the activity is related to a refund (e.g., **Points Refunded**):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the refund ID">
    Click the **refund ID** shown in the log.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review refund details">
    You will be directed to a **Refund Details** panel. This panel includes:
    - **Refund ID** and **Refund Date**
    - **Merchant** and **Branch**
    - **Points Refunded**
    - A **View Order Details** button that links back to the original order.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This allows you to connect refund activity back to the original transaction for full context.

## Important Notes

<Note>
- Clicking an **Order ID** opens the original transaction summary.
