## Intro

Understanding your customer base is the foundation of making informed, data-driven decisions. The **Member Analytics** section in Gameball offers a comprehensive view of your enrolled customers, enabling you to track growth, engagement, and overall participation in your loyalty program.

## Overview Metrics

### Enrolled Members

The **total number of customers currently enrolled** in your Gameball loyalty program.

**Calculation:**

1. **Included customers only**: Counts unique customers who are currently enrolled in the program.
2. **Not affected by time filters** -- always shows the real-time total.
3. **Affected by tag/segment filters**: Adjusts based on any applied filters (e.g., VIP Tier, Holiday2025).
4. **Excludes**: Deleted, opted-out, or excluded customers.

### Excluded Members

The **total number of customers currently excluded from the program is "profile marked as inactive"** in your Gameball account.

**Calculation:**

1. **Excluded customers only**: Counts all customers currently "excluded" from the program.
2. **Not affected by time filters** -- always shows the current count.
3. **Affected by tag/segment filters**: Adjusts based on any applied filters (e.g., VIP Tier, Holiday2025).

### New Members

The **number of new customers who joined your program** during the selected time range.

**Calculation:**

1. **Join date first**: Based on the customer's "join date," if available. **Fallback**: If the join date is missing, use the customer's creation date in Gameball.
2. **Impacted by time filters**: Only counts members who joined within the selected date range.
3. **Affected by tag/segment filters**: Adjusts based on any applied filters.

### Member Growth

A **line chart** that visualizes **new customer acquisition over time**.

**Calculation:**

1. **New members**: Based on "join date"; if missing, falls back to creation date in Gameball.
2. **Impacted by time filters**: Reflects the selected date range.
3. **Affected by tag/segment filters**.

The **breakdown of enrolled members across different loyalty tiers** in your program -- for example, Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.

**Calculation:**

1. Count of members grouped by current tier (**based on most recent status**).
2. **Not affected by time filters** -- always shows the current count.
3. **Affected by tag/segment filters**: Will adjust if filters are applied.

## Retention Metrics

### Retention Rate

The percentage of **returning customers** -- those who placed an order in the current period **and** also placed an order in the **previous equivalent period**.

**Calculation:**

1. Retention Rate = (Returning Customers in Current Period / Total Customers in Previous Period) x 100

<Frame>
  ![Retention rate formula](/images/product-docs/analytics/retention-rate-formula.png)
</Frame>

2. A **Returning Customer** is any customer who:
   - Placed **at least one order** in the **current period** (week or month), **and**
   - Also placed **at least one order** in the **previous equivalent period** (the week or month immediately before).
3. **Examples:**
   - In a **monthly view**, a returning customer is someone who ordered this month **and** last month.
   - In a **weekly view**, a returning customer is someone who ordered this week **and** last week.
4. **Impacted by time filters**:
   1. If you select a **custom time range** (e.g., last 3 months) and break the graph **weekly**, the retention calculation is done **period-by-period**.
   2. The graph shows retention for each week within the selected time range.
   3. Each week's retention compares customers who ordered that week to those who ordered in the **previous week**.
5. **Affected by tag/segment filters**.

### Customers Who Placed Orders

Shows the **average number of unique customers per day** who placed at least one order, with results broken down **weekly or monthly**.

**Calculation:**

1. **Weekly Breakdown:**
   1. For each day of the week (Sunday to Saturday), count the **unique customers** who placed at least one order that day.
   2. Sum these daily counts for the week.
   3. Divide the sum by **7** to get the weekly average of daily unique ordering customers.
2. **Monthly Breakdown:**
   1. For each day of the month, count the **unique customers** who placed at least one order.
   2. Sum these daily counts for the month.
   3. Divide the sum by the **total number of days in the month** to get the monthly average of daily unique ordering customers.
3. **Impacted by time filters** -- shows trends over the selected period.
4. **Affected by tag/segment filters**.

### Retention Cohort

Categorizes customers into **Non-Redeemers**, **One-Time Redeemers**, and **Frequent Redeemers** to help you understand long-term customer behavior and loyalty trends.

**Calculation:**

1. **Identify cohort members:**
   - Select **all unique customers** who placed at least one order in the **last 6 months**.
2. **Assign cohorts:**
   - Group each customer into a **monthly cohort** based on the **month of their first purchase**.
3. **Track retention per cohort:** For each subsequent month, calculate:
