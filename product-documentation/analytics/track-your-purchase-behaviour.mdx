## What Is the Purchase Behaviour Analytics Page About?

Purchase Behaviour analytics gives you insights into customer purchase habits and how Gameball directly influences their spending. You'll find detailed data about order values, purchase frequency, lifetime value, and attributed revenue.

Here is the explanation of each piece of information on the customer Purchase Behaviour page:

- **Attributed Sales:** Total number of purchases directly influenced by Gameball.
