### What Is the Campaign Performance Analytics Page About?

The Customer Behaviour & Engagement analytics section gives you a detailed insight into how your customers are interacting with the deployed engagement programs using Gameball. It, therefore, leaves you with more knowledge of how Gameball is impacting your business and how it is contributing to achieving your targets and business goals.

Campaign Performance analytics provides you with insights into the reach and success of your reward campaigns. You can track how many customers interact with your campaigns, measure completion rates, monitor reward costs, and identify which campaigns drive the highest engagement.

Here is the explanation of each piece of information on the Campaign Performance page:

- **Reward Campaign Reach:** Number of members targeted by reward campaigns.

- **Total Customers Achieved Reward Campaigns:** Number of members who completed reward campaigns.
