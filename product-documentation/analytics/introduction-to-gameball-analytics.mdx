## What Do I Need to Know Before Diving Into the Analytics?

When looking straight at numbers and graphs for the first time, it might seem complicated or hard to grasp.

Here are some quick tips that will help you figure out what each number or graph means and how to navigate and assemble them according to your preferences:

### A. Analytics Time Span

When you are on any of the analytics pages, you can display the data from a particular time span or display all the data from the time you activated your program.

Click on the button at the top right of any page to select your preferred time span.

When you apply a time span filter, data that is impacted by this will show the progression or difference of numbers according to the selected period.

### B. Tooltip for Data Elaboration

If you find yourself uncertain about what specific data refers to precisely, use your cursor to point at the **Information Icon** beside the data title to read a brief explanation about it.
