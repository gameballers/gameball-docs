There are plenty of tools Gameball offers to attract visitors to enroll and become more engaged. Here are some ideas you can implement for a guaranteed increase in acquisition:

## Guest Messages

With the correct articulation, timing, and placement where a message appears, you can sell your visitors the loyalty experience created to reward them just for being active. Gameball Messages not only targets the registered customers, but you can also reach out to the unregistered customers, "guests", and encourage them not to miss out on the great rewards.

## Signup Reward Campaign

The SignUp campaign is a powerful tool to draw in visitors and motivate them to register for your loyalty programs. With an attractive reward and other great challenges, they could explore and benefit from just signing up.

## Referral Program

Let your loyal customers encourage guests to sign up!

By creating an appealing referral program where both your customers and their friends get solid rewards, you will see a noticeable number of registrations within a short period of time.

## Cashback

Cashback is a well-known method that has various benefits. Not only will it increase your sales, but it will also encourage your customers to register for your loyalty experience before they complete any purchase. This way, they will get part of their spending back in the form of points, which they can redeem in the form of coupons and use on new purchases.

Make sure to inform your customers of the signup campaign and the cashback program through the widget or a guest message.
