### Why should you integrate Segment with your Gameball account? And how can you make the best out of Gameball customer attributes?

This integration will allow you to target and segment your customers based on how loyal they are to your app. This integration will allow you to:

1.  Segment your contact lists based on Gameball customer attributes.

2.  Trigger an automation based on Gameball customers' attributes.

3.  Send more personalized emails by including Gameball customer information in email templates, for instance, the customer's current tier.


## How to configure Segment on Gameball?

-   Add the events you want to track in the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**.


For more info on how to do that, [check out this article](/product-documentation/admin-settings/create-and-send-events). Here is an example:

</Frame>

-   Add the Gameball app as a destination from the Segment catalog

-   Add your Gameball API Key in the destinations settings on Segment. Learn [where to find your Gameball API key](/product-documentation/admin-settings/get-api-keys)

-   Ensure that the events you track reach Gameball through the Event Tester on Segment with the Event Builder

</Frame>

In the previous example, the Event name is (Buy product) and (type) shoes

**_Note:_** _The **Event Name** in Event Tester on Segment is the same Event Name in **Gameball Admin Dashboard, and you must include userId.**_

-   Ensure that the events you track reach Gameball  through the Event Tester in Segment with the JSON Builder


<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/apps-integrations/apps-integrations-92.png" />
</Frame>

Event name is (Buy product) and (type) shoes

**_Note:_** _The only properties supported for updating through events at the moment are the ones in the_ customer _Info box, which are:_

-   ID

-   Join Date

-   Level Name

-   Type ID

-   Points

-   Score Balance

-   Level ID

-   Completed Challenges
