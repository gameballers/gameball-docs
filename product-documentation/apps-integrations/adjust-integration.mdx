##### Can I create a referral links without using deep link generators like Adjust?

The referral process can be completed without using a deep link generator like Adjust. In such cases, you will need to provide your own referral link. Gameball will simply append the referral code to it.

Deep link generators are only responsible for generating the link that appears in the referral widget. If you’re not using one, the referral link will follow this format:

-   {referralLink}?GbReferral={referralCode}


You will then need to handle the referral logic manually, including capturing the referral code and passing it in the _create customer_ request.
