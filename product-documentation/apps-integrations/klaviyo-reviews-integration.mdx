## Gameball Use Cases

With this integration, you can enhance your customer engagement by:

-   **Reward Customers for Reviews**: Use Reward Campaigns to automatically grant points, discounts, or other incentives when customers leave a review. This approach not only shows appreciation for customer feedback but also encourages repeat purchases and positive brand advocacy. [Learn More](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-action-based-reward-campaign).

-   **Automated Follow-Up Messaging**: Create Communication Campaigns that send targeted emails or notifications via Klaviyo in response to customer reviews. You can thank customers for high ratings, provide special offers, or reach out to lower-rated reviews with additional support or exclusive discounts.

-   **Review-Triggered Automations**: Incorporate review events as triggers in Automation Campaigns to personalize customer journeys. For instance, automatically add reviewers who gave a high rating to a VIP list or trigger a win-back offer for customers with lower ratings to improve their experience.
