## Use Cases for Gameball and Recharge Integration

1.  ## **Enhance Customer Retention with Subscription-Based Rewards:**

    -   Use the integration to offer exclusive discounts on subscriptions. For example, create a `RechargeFixed` reward to give loyal customers a flat discount on their next month’s subscription, encouraging them to continue using the service.

2.  ## **Boost Subscriptions with Limited-Time Discounts:**

    -   Create `RechargePercentage` rewards to offer percentage-based discounts for a limited period. This can drive new sign-ups and encourage existing customers to upgrade their subscriptions.

3.  ## **Target High-Value Subscribers:**

    -   Leverage Gameball’s segmentation capabilities to identify and reward high-value subscribers. Offer them tailored discounts through the Recharge platform to enhance loyalty and increase the lifetime value of customers.
