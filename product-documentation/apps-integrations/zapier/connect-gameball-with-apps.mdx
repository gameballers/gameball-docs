## How to create a Zapier connection?

## **Step 1:** Choosing a Trigger and an Action Apps

Follow these steps to create a zap between Gameball and any other app on Zapier:

-   Go to [zapier.com](http://zapier.com)

-   In the left box search for any app you want to set as the [trigger app](/product-documentation/apps-integrations/zapier/connecting-gameball-to-zapier).


In the upcoming steps, we will use **SurveyMonkey** as the trigger app to guide you on how to give players a reward upon survey form submission. Please note that in order to use this feature, you must be on a paid plan on SurveyMonkey.

</Frame>

-   Click **Try it**


## **Step 2:** Configure Trigger On Zapier

On Zapier, a **trigger** is any event that you want to use to start a Zap. Read more on [triggers](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/set-up-your-zap-trigger) on Zapier. Once you've set up a Zap, Zapier will keep monitoring that player event.

In this use case, the trigger will be done through SurveyMonkey. But first, you must make sure that your players submit their email addresses in the survey. We will be using the email address to identify your players, so the email address submitted must match the one on your platform that is stored at Gameball.

Follow the below steps to create a Zap between SurveyMonkey and Gameball:

## **Step 3:** Configure Action

An **action** is a job your Zap does once your trigger event occurs. Read more on [actions](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/set-up-your-zap-action) on Zapier.

In this use case, the action will be done on Gameball through the following steps:

### **A. Choose App & Event**

Choose App as Gameball and Action as "Send Event"

**_Note:_** _this is the only event_

</Frame>

### **B. Choose Gameball Account**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/apps-integrations/apps-integrations-139.png" />
</Frame>

### **C. Customize Event**

Add the event name, event metadata (if needed), and player email.

**_Note:_** Make sure you add the name in this format: "appname\_eventname", leave metadata empty if metadata is not needed and finally add the player email to choose the player you want to give this reward to.

_If you enter an email to a player that is not already created on Gameball, this event will not be sent and the player will be created on Gameball._

### **D. Send Data**

Click on Test & Review or Test & Continue

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/apps-integrations/apps-integrations-140.png" />
</Frame>

**_Note:_** _without testing the connection between the two apps and solving all errors, the trigger event will not be sent to Gameball, and you will not be able to reward your players even if they complete the required action._

-   Finally, click **turn on Zap** and move to configure challenge on Gameball.
