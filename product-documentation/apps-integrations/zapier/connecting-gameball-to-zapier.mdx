This helps you automate repetitive tasks saving you time and effort.

If for example, you want Gameball to reward players when they make a specific action on a different app, Zapier is the perfect tool to help with doing that.

## How does Zapier works?

If you are connecting two different applications using Zapier, Zapier can execute an action on one of the two applications when a certain trigger happens on the other one.
