## Applying Retention Strategies Using RFM Segments

Segmenting your customers using RFM is a crucial step toward delivering more personalized and effective engagement. Once your customers are categorized, you can tailor campaigns and strategies that match the unique behavior of each segment.

For example, with the **Best Buyers** segment, you may want to reward these high-value customers with exclusive offers to ensure they remain active and loyal. For customers in segments like **About to Lose** or **Lost**, you might focus on reactivation tactics such as time-limited discounts or reminders.

Gameball supports you with recommended actions and ready-made templates for each segment, helping you build strategies that align with your goals.
