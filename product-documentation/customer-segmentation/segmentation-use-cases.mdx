Segmentation is one of the most impactful tools you can use to personalize your marketing efforts and increase return on investment (ROI). With Gameball's segmentation feature, you can identify and act on specific customer behaviors, interests, and engagement levels to optimize your communication and retention tactics.

Targeting the mass market without distinction is no longer an effective approach. Instead, focusing on well-defined customer segments allows you to deliver the right message to the right audience. This article demonstrates how to build and engage with critical customer segments using Gameball's segmentation and other platform features.

## Customer Segments and Tactics

Gameball enables you to identify and engage with multiple customer segments. Below are four common and highly valuable segments you may want to target, along with tactics to improve their engagement:

- **The Champions**: Your top-performing VIP customers who contribute a significant portion of your revenue.
- **Product Viewers**: Customers who explore your products but do not proceed to checkout.
- **Slipping Away Customers**: Customers who are showing signs of churn and disengagement.
- **The Buyer**: Segments customers into groups based on different purchasing behavior.

### The Champions (VIP Customers)

**Identify Bases for Segmentation**

A VIP customer could be someone who:

- Made a purchase within the last 30 days

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Total Amount Spent Filter">
    Add another filter: **Total Amount Spent** with the operator **greater than** and the value set to **$5,000**.

**Identify Bases for Segmentation**

For instance, if your **jeans product page** is frequently visited but sees low conversions:

**Create a New Segment**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select View Product Page Event">
    Choose **Event** as the segmentation type. Select **View Product Page**, and use the **First Occurrence greater than 30 days**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Product Title Filter">
    Add a second filter:

    - Event: **View Product Page**
    - Add an **Event Filter**: Product Title **contains** "jeans"

- Offer promotional discounts specific to the product category.
</Tip>

- No website visits in the last 60 days
- No point redemptions in the last 90 days

**Create a New Segment**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Last Order Date Filter">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Last Login Date Filter">
    Add **Customer Attribute: Last Login Date greater than 60 days**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Last Redemption Date Filter">
    Add **Customer Attribute: Last Redemption Date greater than 90 days**.

</Steps>

<Tip>
**Use Other Gameball Features**

- Create a **scheduled challenge** for this segment with an **achievement reward**.
- Set up an **email notification** to communicate the reward and encourage re-engagement.
</Tip>

### The Buyer: Product-Level Order Segmentation

You can now create **highly targeted and personalized campaigns** by analyzing **specific product purchase behavior**. Segment customers based on the exact products and quantities purchased in actual orders.

For example:

- Target customers who purchased a specific SKU.
- Segment customers buying a particular category or high-quantity product.

**Key Features:**

**Product Line Item Filters:**

- Product ID
- SKU
- Category
- Collection
- Product Title
- Quantity Purchased (per product)
- Price (per line item)

<Warning>
- All segments in Gameball are dynamic. This means the system continuously updates customer groupings based on real-time behavior and data.
- Avoid static segmentation to ensure the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of your campaigns.
