When creating different segments with specific conditions and rules, you will gain valuable insights into your overall pool of customers and their behavior. This allows you to plan more efficient, data-driven marketing strategies that improve overall performance.

## How to Create Segments

Creating a new segment is simple. Begin by identifying the criteria you want to target from your wide customer base. For instance, you can create a segment for female customers who have been active within the past 30 days and frequently visit a specific product category. Once these rules are configured, Gameball will automatically identify any customer who meets the criteria and add them to the segment.

## How to Use the Segmentation Rule Engine

You can create a segment using a single or multiple conditions. Begin by creating the first rule.

### Choosing "Customer Attribute"

When selecting **Customer Attribute**, choose the customer profile data that will determine segment membership.

<Frame>
  ![Customer attribute selection](/images/product-docs/customer-segmentation/customer-attribute-selection.png)
</Frame>

Available attributes include:

| Category | Attributes |
|---|---|
| **Customer Info** | Customer Email, Mobile Number, Gender, Date Of Birth, Customer Creation Date, Customer Join Date, Is Guest Customer, Is Referred, Country, City, Zip Code |
| **Engagement** | Score, Points, Tier, Channel, Merchant, Branch, Last Login Date |
| **Order Data** | Total Orders Count, Total Amount Spent, Last Order Date, Average Order Value |
| **Gameball Tracked** | Last Captured Order Date, Average Captured Order Value, Total Captured Orders, Total Captured Amount Spent |
| **Redemption** | Total Redeemed Amount, Total Redemptions, Last Redemption Date, Last Coupon Usage, Last Gameball Coupon Usage |
| **Referral** | Total Referrals, Last Referral Date |
| **Communication** | Last Message Sent Date, Last Email Sent Date |
| **UTM Tracking** | UTM Campaign, UTM Source, UTM Medium, UTM Content, UTM Term |
| **Device Info** | Device, Browser, Operating System |
| **Product Data** | Product ID, SKU, Category, Collection, Product Title, Quantity Purchased (per product), Price (per line item) |
| **Spending** | Total Spent, Orders Count |

After choosing the attribute, define its metadata values accordingly.

<Note>
1. "Total captured orders" is calculated via Gameball, which counts the number of orders sent via the Order API. However, the "total amount spent" relies on you sending the total orders of every customer via the API from your side. Therefore, choose the correct attribute based on whether you need the source of data from your side or data counted by Gameball.

2. All attributes that are automatically calculated and maintained by Gameball are visually prefixed with **"Gameball"** so you can recognize them amongst your custom attributes sent through API.
</Note>

### Choosing "Customer Event"

Events represent actions customers perform on your platform.

To create an event-based segment rule:

1. Select the relevant **Customer Event**.
2. Define the **event metadata**.
   Example: If the event is "viewing a product," you can filter it to include customers who viewed a product in the _Accessories_ category at least three times.

You can also:

- Click **Add Event Filter** to add more metadata filters to a single event.
- Click **Add Condition** to include multiple conditions under the same rule.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Choosing "Order"

You can create customer segments based on **actual order data**, providing more accurate, real-time customer targeting.

**Order data includes:**

- Count
- First Occurrence
- Last Occurrence
- Total Order Value (excluding fully refunded orders)
- Order Date Range
- Average Order Value
- Specific Order Value Ranges

<Note>
Fully refunded orders are excluded by default from the calculations.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple segment conditions include both Customer Attribute and Customer Event at the same time?">
    Yes. You can combine both customer profile attributes and behavior-based events in one segment. For example, you can create a segment that includes:

    - Female customers
    - Under 50 years old
    - Recently active on your platform
    - Made at least one purchase or added an item to the cart within the past month

    This allows for precise targeting using detailed, multi-criteria rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do you create multiple conditions under one segment?">
    After adding the first rule:

    1. Click **Add Rule**.
    2. Choose the correlation type between rules:
        - **AND**: Customers must meet all rules.
        - **OR**: Customers must meet at least one rule.
    3. Repeat the rule setup process for each additional rule.
