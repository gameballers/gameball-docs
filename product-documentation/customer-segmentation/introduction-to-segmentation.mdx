Customer segmentation enables you to target specific groups of customers for personalized communication, reward campaigns, and more. With Gameball, segmentation is dynamic and automatic, saving you the time and effort of manually grouping customers and keeping your segments up to date.

Have you ever wanted to create a challenge, send a message, or apply a redemption rule that only applies to a specific group of customers -- but couldn't figure out how to isolate and target them accurately? Even when you managed to identify these customers, applying manual tags became time-consuming and inaccurate, especially since customers' behavior changes frequently. This often means that by the time you've tagged a customer, they may no longer belong to the intended group.

To solve this challenge, Gameball introduced **Customer Segmentation** -- a feature that helps you create dynamic lists of customers who automatically qualify based on the criteria you set.

## How Customer Segmentation Works

Customer segmentation automatically groups your customers based on their behavior and profile data. Unlike manual tags, segments are dynamic: customers are added or removed in real time based on whether they meet the defined conditions.

In simple terms, when a customer meets all the conditions of a segment, they are automatically added to it. If their data changes and no longer matches those conditions, they are automatically removed.

## Why Segment Customers?

Segmentation helps you gain valuable insights and execute targeted marketing strategies. With Gameball, segmentation enables the following:

- Gain deeper insights into customer behavior.
- Build dynamic, data-driven, and personalized marketing strategies.
- Target specific customer groups across various Gameball features.

You can use customer segments with:

- **Reward Campaigns**: Reward only specific segments.
- **Redemption Rules**: Apply rules like free shipping to certain segments.
- **Communication Campaigns**: Launch targeted campaigns or send messages to selected segments.

## Existing Segments vs. Custom Segments

Gameball provides two built-in segments that help you monitor essential customer behaviors:

### Active Users

- Last login: within the last 30 days
- OR last order date: within the last 30 days
- Color: Green
- Segment Tag: Active

### Inactive Users

- Last login: more than 60 days ago
- OR login is empty
- Last order date: more than 90 days ago
- Color: Orange
- Segment Tag: Inactive

In addition, you can create, edit, or delete your own segments based on your business needs.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Segments">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Segment">
    Click **Create New Segment**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Conditions">
    Define the conditions for your segment. For example:
