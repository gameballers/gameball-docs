## Referral Program Configuration

### 1. Referral Reward

Gameball allows you to decide who gets rewarded in your referral program. You can choose to reward:

- **Both the customer and their friend**
- **Only the customer**

![Referral Reward Options](/images/product-docs/programs/referral-program/referral-reward-options.png)

To configure the referral reward:

1. Click **Edit** in the **Referral Reward** section.

2. Under **Friend's Action**, choose what qualifies a referral as successful:

    - The friend completes their first purchase (account creation not required).
    - The friend creates an account and completes a specific action, such as:
        - Completing their first purchase
        - Triggering a custom event that you have configured

## Multi-Step Rewards \[Add-on\]

Multi-step rewards allow you to incentivize both your customers and their friends at different stages of the referral journey.

For example, you can reward a customer when their friend:

- Creates an account
- Completes an order

![Multi-Step Referrals](/images/product-docs/programs/referral-program/multi-step-referrals.png)

To configure multi-step rewards:

1. Click **Add New Step**.

2. Set the **friend's action** for this step.

3. Choose the **rewards** for both the customer and the friend.

You can now configure multi-step referral flows to mark an event as **"Happens One Time"**, without needing to define additional metadata or complex custom rules.

## FAQ

#### How do I generate and track referral deep links?

You can use Branch.io and Adjust to generate and track referral links for your customers.

**Branch.io** and **Adjust** are tools used to create dynamic referral links, **primarily for clients with mobile apps** who want to redirect users to their app. Both platforms offer free plans, but these come with limits based on the number of Monthly Active Users (MAUs) or attributions.

- [Read about how to integrate **Branch.io** with Gameball](https://developer.gameball.co/branch.io-integration)
- [Read about how to integrate **Adjust** with Gameball](https://developer.gameball.co/adjust-integration)

For web-only clients (those without a mobile app), there is no need to use Branch or Adjust.

### Can I create referral links without using deep link generators like Branch.io and Adjust?

The referral process can be completed without using a deep link generator like Branch or Adjust. In such cases, you will need to provide your own referral link. Gameball will simply append the referral code to it.

Deep link generators are only responsible for generating the link that appears in the referral widget. If you're not using one, the referral link will follow this format:

- `{referralLink}?GbReferral={referralCode}`

You will then need to handle the referral logic manually, including capturing the referral code and passing it in the _create customer_ request.

### Can I show referral codes rather than links?

You can choose to display a customer's **referral code** instead of the full referral link, making it easier for customers to copy, share, and use referrals during sign-up especially in offline or manual flows.

From the dashboard, navigate to **Widget > General > Visibility > Referral Page**.
You can choose whether referral experiences display the full referral link or only the customer's unique referral code.

![Referral Code Display](/images/product-docs/programs/referral-program/referral-code-display.png)

This is supported across both web and mobile, ensuring a unified experience wherever customers engage.
