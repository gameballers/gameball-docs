## How Will Customers View Their Tier Experience?

Customers can easily track their progress and learn about available tiers directly through the **Tiers card** displayed on the **home page of the Gameball widget**. This card shows their **current tier status** at a glance. When customers click on the card, they are taken to a detailed view where they can explore:

- The **available tier** they can upgrade to.
- The **requirements** to reach the next tier.
- The **benefits and perks** associated with each tier.

This interactive experience ensures customers are always aware of their current tier, how they can progress, and the value they'll receive as they move up.
