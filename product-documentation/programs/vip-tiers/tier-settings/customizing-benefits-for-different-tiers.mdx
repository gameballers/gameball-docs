## Return Window Duration for Tier Entry Reward Points

<Warning>
**Prevent temporary reward abuse** by locking tier-entry points until the return window expires. This ensures customers cannot instantly redeem tier-upgrade rewards and then refund their qualifying orders to gain unfair benefits.
</Warning>

With this update, tier-entry points can be temporarily **locked (pending)** until the configured window expires, improving reward integrity and reducing fraudulent behavior.

<Frame>
  ![Return Window Duration](/images/product-docs/programs/vip-tiers/return-window-duration.png)
</Frame>

### Configuration

A new field is now available inside each **Tier Entry Reward** setup:

- **Return Window Duration (days)**
- Accepts numeric values greater than or equal to 0
- Default value: **0 days** (points activate immediately)

This gives you full control over how long tier-reward points stay locked before becoming usable.

### Updated Reward Logic

When a customer levels up to a new tier:

- Entry reward points are issued with **status = pending**.
- Pending duration matches the configured Return Window Duration.
- Points automatically switch to **status = active** once the window expires.

This ensures points cannot be redeemed during the waiting period.

### Refund and Downgrade Behavior

The system now handles return-window scenarios more intelligently:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Refund or Tier Downgrade **before** activation | Pending points are **revoked automatically** |
| Refund **after** activation | Standard refund deduction rules apply, as usual |

This eliminates the temporary gain loophole that customers could previously exploit.

## Customers Discovering Tier Benefits
