  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Benefits" icon="gift">
  - **Entry and Lifetime Rewards** — Reward your customers for reaching new tiers with points, free products, discounts, and exclusive offers to incentivize continued engagement.

  - **Earning Points Configuration** — Customize the earning points system per tier. For example, customers on tier 2 could get 10 points for every dollar they spend instead of the default setup.

  - **Custom Benefits** — Go beyond traditional rewards and offer custom benefits to customers on specific tiers. Whether it's access to VIP products or exclusive events, unleash your creativity to enhance the customer experience.

  <Tip>
  **Return Window Duration for Tier Entry Reward Points** — Prevent temporary reward abuse by locking tier-entry points until the return window expires. This ensures customers cannot instantly redeem tier-upgrade rewards and then refund their qualifying orders.

## Refunded Orders Behavior

When **Refunded Orders** setting is enabled:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Enabled | Refunded orders **do not** count toward tier progress; earned progress is deducted |
| Disabled | Refunded orders remain included (default) |

<Info>
Tier progress in both the **dashboard** and **widget** automatically reflects the updated calculation. Progress reductions from refunds are shown in real time.
</Info>

<Warning>
If a refund lowers a customer's total spending below their current tier threshold, they will be downgraded accordingly. If downgraded, any entry reward given as points will be removed, while coupon rewards will remain. Customers can reclaim entry rewards each time they requalify. The system tracks tier changes, reward adjustments, and refund impacts while maintaining logs for auditing and fraud detection.
</Warning>
