## What Happens When You Manually Update a Customer's Tier?

Below is a list of all rules for manually changing the tier of a customer:

- You will be able to see if the customer resides on a tier because of manual intervention. You will also be able to see the type of tier behavior you set and the reason for the manual adjustment if you have written any.
- When extracting a CSV file of the customers' data, you will find a column that includes information about whether there was a manual tier adjustment for each customer.
- If a customer is manually added to a tier, they will be able to see that and will see the expiry date for staying on that tier (if it exists).

- Gameball integrated apps will be updated with the new tier of the customer.
- When manually adjusting the tier for single or multiple customers, they will receive the tier welcome reward that you have assigned to each tier. They will also receive an email if they were relocated to a higher tier and if the tier email achievement is **on**.
