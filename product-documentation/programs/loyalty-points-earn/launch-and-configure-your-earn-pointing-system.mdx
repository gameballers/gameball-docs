## Settings

### Include or Exclude Shipping Fee

Decide whether to include the shipping fee in the points calculation. For example, if a customer places an order worth USD 100 with a USD 15 shipping fee, they can either receive points on just the USD 100 or on the full USD 115.

</Frame>

### Points Expiry

Define when earned points will expire:

- Choose the **expiry duration**.
- Select the **duration type** (days, months, or years).

<Frame>
  ![Points Expiry Settings](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/points-expiry-settings.png)
</Frame>

<Accordion title="How does Points Expiry Work?" icon="clock">
When setting a customer duration for point expiry to 3 days for example, from a Reward Campaign, the points will expire exactly 72 hours after the earning time. Gameball does not round up or down to the nearest day; instead, it calculates the exact time based on the specified duration.
</Accordion>

### Eligible Collections

Select which products or collections qualify for earning points. Choose from:

- All Products
- Selected Collection
- All Products except some collections

<Frame>
  ![Eligible Collections](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/eligible-collections.png)
</Frame>

### Return Window Duration

Specify a time gap between when an order is placed and when points are issued. This helps manage potential product returns and ensures proper point issuance.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What happens if a customer returns a product after earning points?">
Use the **Return Window Duration** setting to delay point issuance, helping avoid rewarding points for refunded purchases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I create different earn rules for different products?">
Yes, use the **Collection Rules** feature to customize earning by product categories.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have an order-level return window?">
Yes, you can set a return window at the order level.

To do this, include the `returnWindow` attribute inside the `cashbackConfigurations` object when creating the order using the **Order API**. This allows you to specify a custom return window per order -- for example, 7 days for Order A and 10 days for Order B.

If `returnWindow` is not set in the API request, the default duration from your Gameball settings will apply.
