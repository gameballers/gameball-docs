As a multi-brand company, you might be facing some difficulties with unifying your customer engagement under one loyalty experience. Gameball has now made that possible with its [Merchants feature](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-earn/crossover-reward-program/gameball-merchants-crossover-rewards-experience).

You can easily create a crossover rewards experience where your customers can redeem and use cashback points with every purchase they make at any of your brands or stores. They can also receive a different cashback value depending on the brand.

This article tackles the first step, which is creating a new merchant for your brand or store.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
- Merchant ID and Branch ID must be **unique**. They are used by Gameball APIs to identify the merchant/brand and branch.
- If you have completed the integration process using Gameball APIs and a transaction is made with a brand or branch that does not exist in Gameball, the system will automatically create a new merchant name and ID to complete the transaction.
- After adding all the brands to your platform, you must configure the cashback rules for each brand.
</Warning>
