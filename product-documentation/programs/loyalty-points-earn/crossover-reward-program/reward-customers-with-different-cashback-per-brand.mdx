</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Cashback Rule">
Fill in the required information:

- **Choose Merchant:** Select the brand you want to create the new cashback rule for.
- **Configuration Method:** Choose between:
  - **Cashback Value:** Set a cashback percentage based on the customer's paid amount. Example: If you offer 5% cashback and a customer pays $100, they will receive $5 cashback worth of points.
  - **Cashback Value Based on Unit:** Set a fixed number of points per currency unit regardless of the cashback percentage. Example: If a customer pays $100, they could receive 1000 points based on your configuration.
  - **Fixed Cashback Value:** Set a fixed cashback value for the customer to earn based on their purchase.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Click **Save Changes**.

If your cashback program is active, your customers will now receive the specified cashback once they place and pay for an order from the brands you have added and configured a cashback rule for.

## Important Notes

<Note>
- By default, every newly created merchant will fall under your default cashback rules unless a specific rule is configured.
- You can create different cashback rules based on each merchant's level.
- Merchant-specific cashback rules override the default cashback rules if the customer purchases from a recognized merchant.
</Note>

**Example:** If you have different cashback rules per level under your default cashback settings, but only one general cashback rule for a specific merchant, the merchant rule will apply to the customer regardless of their level.
