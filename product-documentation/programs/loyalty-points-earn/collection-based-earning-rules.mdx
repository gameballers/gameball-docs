<Frame>
  ![Cashback Options](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/cashback-options-popup.png)
</Frame>

- **All Products:** The default cashback rule applies to all products. You can add extra cashback rules for different levels.
- **Selected Collections:** Cashback will only apply to the selected collections. Purchases from other collections will not be eligible for cashback.
- **All Products Except Some Collections:** Cashback applies to all collections except the ones you exclude. Purchases from excluded collections will not earn cashback.
- **Custom Cashback:** You can define different cashback values for different collections. After saving, further configuration is required.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Your Selection">

<Frame>
  ![Save Cashback Selection](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/save-cashback-selection.gif)
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
- If you select **All Products**, **Selected Collections**, or **All Products Except Some Collections**, no further configuration is needed. Just ensure your default cashback rule is correctly set.
- If you choose **Custom Cashback**, you deactivate the **Merchant** feature on the system. Cashback based on collections and crossover cashback cannot work simultaneously.

<Frame>
  ![Add Collection Rule](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/add-collection-rule.png)
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Cashback Rule">
Configure your cashback rule:

<Frame>
  ![Configure Cashback Rule](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/configure-cashback-rule.gif)
</Frame>

- **Select Collection/s:** Mark the collections for this rule.
- **Collection Rule Name:** Name the rule for easy identification.
- **Cashback Method:** Choose between:

  - **Cashback value** (percentage-based cashback) -- State the percentage of the cashback you want to grant for orders from that collection.
  - **Cashback value based on unit** (points-based cashback) -- State the amount of points you want to give for every dollar they spend buying from the specified collection.
  - **Fixed Cashback Value** -- This is ideal if you want to offer **consistent point rewards per collection**, regardless of the product's price.

<Info>
**Fixed Cashback Value** is perfect for exclusive items. For example, if you want to reward 100 points per product in the "New Arrivals" collection, regardless of whether an item costs $20 or $200.

To enable fixed cashback, you must send the following details **per item** in the Order API: Collection ID(s), Price, Discount, Taxes, and Product ID.
</Info>

**Fixed Cashback Key Rules:**
- If an item belongs to multiple collections, Gameball will reward based on the **highest fixed point value**.
- If multiple different items from the same collection are purchased, the fixed points reward applies per item.
- The **fixed points reward will still respect active Points Multiplier Campaigns** (e.g., Double Points: 200 becomes 400).
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Cashback Value and Save">
Enter the cashback value.

<Frame>
  ![Enter Cashback Value](/images/product-docs/programs/loyalty-points-earn/enter-cashback-value.png)
</Frame>

Click **Save**. Customers will now enjoy collection-specific cashback rates. The newly created rules will be visible under the **Collection Rules** tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
- To add more rules for different collections, click **Add Collection Rule** and repeat the process.
- To edit a rule, click the **Edit Icon**.
- To delete a rule, click the **Bin Icon**.
</Tip>
