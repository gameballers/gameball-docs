Through tags, you can simulate endless rewards to be automatically granted to a group of your customers based on their applied tags. You will be able to add tag(s) to your reward campaigns; [customers who have that same tag applied](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/gameball-customers) will be the only ones able to participate in and enroll in these campaigns.

To let you understand this more and how you can do magic through tags, check the illustration below:

## How to Add Tag(s) on a Reward Campaign

### Option 1: While creating a new reward campaign

During the [reward campaign creation](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/reward-campaign-general-setup-guide) or editing of a campaign template, add a tag at the first step under the **Audience**.

</Frame>

### Option 2: By editing the existing Reward Campaign

On your **Gameball dashboard**, go to **Campaigns > Rewards**.

Click the **three-dot icon** at any campaign, then click **Edit**.

</Frame>

</Frame>

Repeat the same step as if you are adding a tag to a campaign that is being created.

<Note>You can remove tags from the reward campaign from the same place.</Note>
