Gameball provides multiple reward campaign types that can help you engage and retain your customers in different ways. Among them, **Stamps**, **Milestone**, and **Mission** campaigns may seem similar at first glance, but each serves a unique purpose and works differently.

This article highlights the differences between these campaign types in terms of functionality, objectives, and best use cases, so you can choose the right one for your business needs.

| Platform | Plan |
|----------|------|
| Shopify | Pro, and Guru / (Milestone is an Add-on) |
| Salla | Pro, and Guru / (Milestone is an Add-on) |
| Non-Platform | Add-on |

Gameball offers three main types of reward campaigns to drive repeated engagement:

## Stamp Campaigns

A **Stamp campaign** rewards customers when they complete a specific action repeatedly within a set timeframe without interruption.

</Frame>

- **How it works:** Customers must perform the same action a number of times over a defined period (for example, logging in 7 times within 10 days) or (for example, completing 5 purchases or referring 3 friends within the next month). If they do not log in that many times within 10 days, they will not be rewarded.
- **Objective:** To encourage consistency and regular engagement with your brand.
- **Best use cases:**
  - Daily check-ins or app logins
  - Regular purchases
  - Maintaining weekly activity

## Milestone Campaigns

A **Milestone campaign** rewards customers after they reach a specific achievement point or threshold.

</Frame>

- **How it works:** Customers perform an action repeatedly until they hit a predefined target (For example, reach a specific amount of spendings, or completing 10 orders). Unlike streaks, milestones do not require consecutive actions.
- **Objective:** To motivate customers to achieve larger goals over time.
- **Best use cases:**
  - Accumulated purchases
  - Total referrals
  - Reaching a spending target

## Mission Campaigns

A **Mission campaign** is a more flexible type of campaign that allows you to combine different actions into one reward journey.

</Frame>

- **How it works:** Customers need to complete a set of actions, either in sequence or within a defined timeframe, to earn a reward. Actions can be diverse, such as completing a purchase, leaving a review, and visiting a specific page.
- **Objective:** To create engaging customer journeys that highlight different behaviors you want to promote.
- **Best use cases:**
  - Multi-step onboarding journeys
  - Seasonal campaigns with varied actions
  - Gamified experiences with diverse challenges
- **Example:** You want to run a seasonal campaign for Black Friday. A customer earns a reward after completing these three actions:
  1. Add an item to the cart
  2. Make a purchase
  3. Share the offer on social media
