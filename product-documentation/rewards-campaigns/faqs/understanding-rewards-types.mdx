## Dynamic Value for "Fixed Coupon Rewards"

**Fixed Coupon Rewards** has a **Dynamic Value option**. Instead of being limited to a static reward (e.g., $10 off), you can now configure fixed coupons to dynamically calculate their value based on a percentage of a chosen variable (e.g., **15% of Value X**). In short, instead of always giving $10 off, a merchant can now set the coupon to equal **15% of the customer's cart total or a specific metadata value**, making offers more personalized and impactful.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/faqs/rewards-type-dynamic-value.png" alt="Dynamic value configuration" />
</Frame>

- You can select whether a fixed coupon has:
  - A **static fixed value** (e.g., $10).
  - A **dynamic value** (percentage of a chosen metric).

- Easily adapt offers to cart totals, order values, or metadata-driven actions.

- No changes required in workflow, just configure the value type when setting up your fixed coupon rewards.
