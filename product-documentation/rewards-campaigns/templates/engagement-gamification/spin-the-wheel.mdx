## Intro

Introduce an element of chance with the Spin the Wheel template. Customers can earn a spin as a reward for their actions, allowing them to win various prizes, from discounts to free products or bonus points. You can also organize weekly contests or lucky draws to encourage customers to return to your platform regularly.

## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **spin the wheel** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Audience**

- **Registered Customers:**
  Customers who have an account on your platform (signed up)

- **Anonymous Customers:**
  Visitors browsing anonymously without providing any contact information or identifiable details (not signed up)

  <Note>
  - Visitors can open the game, submit basic information through the lead form, play, and receive rewards, matching the standalone game URL experience.
  - Widget deep links that open a specific game work for guests as well. The widget would open directly into the game screen and allow participation without login.
  </Note>

- **Specific Customers:**
  You can choose for a specific selection of customers to participate in this campaign by filtering using segments, tags or customer attributes.

**Trigger**

- **Wheel Banner on Widget:**
  A banner will display on your widget's homepage. When customers click the banner, they'll be taken to the game screen where they can spin the wheel.

- **Deep Link:**
  Use the `#gameball-wheel` deep link to trigger the Spin the Wheel campaign from a custom banner or button on your website or app. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**Repeatability**

- By default, customers can spin the wheel **once per day**. A new opportunity to replay it begins at 00:00 AM based on the chosen time zone.
- All Games campaigns support only the Limit per day/week/etc. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**Platform Visibility**

You can choose whether the game campaign is shown on web, mobile, or both, giving you better control over engagement strategies across platforms.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## Rewards Setup

<Frame>
  ![Spin the wheel rewards setup](/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/spin-the-wheel-rewards.png)
</Frame>

**Types**

- Choose from any of the reward types supported by Gameball. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).
- Min & Max Rewards Count:
    - The **minimum** number of rewards allowed is **2**
    - The **maximum** number of rewards allowed is **8**

**Probability**

Enter a numerical value (e.g., 2, 3, 4) to represent the probability of a customer receiving this reward. This means that every spin is completely independent of the previous ones, and the chance of landing on a specific reward is always the same, no matter how many times you've spun the wheel.

- The probability input can accept a value of 0, meaning the reward will not be available.
- Probabilities are calculated based on the sum of all assigned probabilities across the rewards.

<Warning>
While each reward has a set probability, it doesn't guarantee that all rewards will be won equally over time. Some rewards might appear more often, while others might be less frequent. It's all part of the random nature of the game!
</Warning>

- **Probability Adjustments:** The new probability will take effect immediately for future spins. Each spin remains independent, with chances based on the sum of all assigned probabilities.
- **Example**:
    - Reward #1: Probability 1
    - Reward #2: Probability 1
    - Reward #3: Probability 1

    After 100 spins, you might see results like this:
    - Reward #1: 27 times
    - Reward #2: 36 times
    - Reward #3: 37 times

    In another set of 100 spins:
    - Reward #1: 28 times
    - Reward #2: 49 times
    - Reward #3: 23 times

**Reward Limits**

The maximum number of times a specific reward can be claimed by all customers throughout the campaign.

- **Optional Feature:** You can choose to add a reward limit when configuring the campaign.
- **Tracking Wins:** Gameball will track how many times each reward has been won. After the limit is reached, the reward will still appear on the wheel but will no longer be winnable.
- **Reward Limit Adjustment:** If you adjust the reward limit while the campaign is running:
    - **Increase the Limit:** If the new limit is higher, customers can win the reward again.
    - **Decrease the Limit:** If the new limit is lower, the system will prevent the reward from being won if the initial limit was already reached.
    - **Removing a Reward:**
        - Setting a probability to 0 effectively makes the reward unavailable. The reward will still appear on the wheel, but will no longer be winnable.
        - Removing a reward completely will make the reward unavailable on the wheel and unwinnable.
- **Example:**

    Reward 1: Probability 1, Limit: 1
    Reward 2: Probability 1, No Limit
    Reward 3: Probability 1, No Limit

    After 10 spins, the results might look like this:
    - Reward 1: 1 win (limit reached)
    - Reward 2: 5 wins
    - Reward 3: 4 wins

<Note>
- If all rewards have limits and they are reached, customers will see a "No rewards available at the moment" message.
- Drag and drop the created reward to reorder them on the wheel.
</Note>

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. Customers earn rewards through spinning the wheel.
2. Spinning offers a chance to win rewards: discounts, free products, bonus points, and more.
3. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration when they earned a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner (For game-based campaigns)**
- **Intro / Main Screen**
- **Lead Form (if audience set to Anonymous Customers - Not logged in)**
- **Success Screen**
- **No Luck Screen**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artworks.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Important Notes

### Fraud Prevention

In the "Spin the Wheel" campaigns for guests (**Audience is Anonymous/Not Logged-in**), there was a risk of fraud as users can re-enter the campaign by using a new email address, allowing them to gain additional rewards. To address this, the following improvements have been introduced:

1. **Single Spin Per Session:** Guest users can spin the wheel only once per session. After their initial spin, they will be prevented from re-spinning the same wheel within the same session. If they attempt to re-enter, a message will display: "You have already spun the wheel."
2. **Multiple Wheels in Campaign:** For campaigns with multiple wheels, this restriction applies individually to each wheel. Guests can still spin any other wheels they haven't tried, but they cannot re-spin the same wheel they've already used.
3. **Session Restriction:** If a guest opens a new browser tab or window after spinning, the same "You have already spun the wheel" message will appear to ensure consistent limitations across the session.

<Note>
**Customer Eligibility**

Games in the widget update dynamically based on customer eligibility, ensuring customers only see games they can still participate in.

**Games are hidden when customers become ineligible.**

If a customer no longer belongs to the game's target segment, the game is automatically removed from the widget and won't reappear unless eligibility is restored.
</Note>

### Anonymous Option

- If you choose **Anonymous** as the audience, the campaign will be available to visitors who are not yet identified on your store.
- Once enabled, a lead form will automatically appear prompting the customer to enter their information (e.g. name, email).
- This is a great way to collect leads and retarget potential customers later.
- You can fully customize this form by navigating to **Customize Design -> Lead Form**.

<Frame>
  ![Spin the wheel anonymous lead form](/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/spin-the-wheel-lead-form.png)

<Tip>
Customizing the lead form also allows you to add a hyperlink to the **"terms and services"** so that customers can read and accept them before clicking submit.
</Tip>
