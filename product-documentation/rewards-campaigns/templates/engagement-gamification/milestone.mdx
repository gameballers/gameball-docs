## Intro

The **Milestone Campaign** is a rule-based campaign that accumulates a customer's eligible spend or item count across orders during a defined period (e.g., **SAR 500 per month**). Help increase **AOV** and **repeat purchase frequency**.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Spending Milestones**
   Reward based on total spend within a period.
   _Example:_ "Spend **$1000** and get a **$100** gift card."

2. **Collection/Tag/SKU/Branch-Specific Milestones**
   Only spending on a chosen collection/category/SKU counts.
   _Example:_ "Spend **$500** on **Electronics** and get **$50** off your next order."

3. **Items-Purchased Milestones (count)**
   Reward by quantity of items, regardless of price.
   _Example:_ "Buy **10** items and get **20%** off next order."

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer begins the milestone by placing an order that **meets the configured conditions**.
2. Each **eligible order** counts **toward** the customer's progress.
3. Once the milestone is **completed**, the configured reward is issued **immediately** (e.g., points, discount, badge).
4. If the milestone is **repeatable**, completion starts a **new round**: the next eligible order resets progress, and the widget displays the **new progress** toward the next milestone.

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Main Screen**
- **Success Screen**
- **Terms & conditions**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artworks.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.
