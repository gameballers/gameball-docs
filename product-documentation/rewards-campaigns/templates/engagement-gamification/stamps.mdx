## Intro

The **Stamps** campaign allows you to reward customers for completing a specific action multiple times in a row. It's a powerful way to boost repeat behavior and long-term engagement.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Drive Repeat Purchases:**
   Place 3 orders within this month to earn a reward.

2. **Promote High-Value Orders:**
   Make 5 orders over $100 each to get rewarded.

3. **Encourage Category Exploration:**
   Make 3 orders each one from a specific collection (Kids, Women, Men).

4. **Boost Referrals**
   Refer 3 friends to get a premium membership.

## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Stamps** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Trigger**

1. **Define the Streak Length**
   Choose how many times a customer needs to complete the action to earn a reward.
   _Example:_ "The customer must place 5 orders to receive a reward."

2. **Choose the Trigger**
   Select the action you'd like to track -- such as placing an order, referring a friend, etc.

3. **(Optional) Add Rule**
   You can set specific conditions for each action in the streak.
   _Example:_
    - Order 1 must be at least $100
    - Order 2 must be at least $300

</Frame>

<Note>
- You can set **one condition per action** in the streak. For example, require an order to meet a minimum amount or come from a specific collection.
- You **can use different collections for each action**, but you cannot mix condition types (e.g., minimum amount for one action and collection for another). Different values or amounts can be set for each step.
</Note>

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. The customer starts by completing the first required action (e.g., placing an order).
2. They complete each step in the streak in sequence.
3. They receive notifications after each step if event notification is enabled. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).
4. After finishing all the steps, the customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
5. If allowed, they can repeat the streak to earn the reward again as per the repeatability setup. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner**
- **Main Screen**
- **Success Screen**
- **Terms & conditions**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artworks.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Editing a Live Stamps Campaign

Editing a live campaign should be done with care to ensure a smooth experience for your customers. Below, we break down each scenario and its impact.

### Trigger

- The **trigger event**, **trigger condition**, and **streak length** **cannot be edited**.
- If changes are required, the admin must **create a new campaign**.

### Audience

**Audience Edited**

- All existing customers are **re-evaluated**.
- Customers who no longer match the updated audience are **automatically exited** from the campaign.

**Auto-Removed from Audience (e.g., segment change)**

- The same behavior applies -- the customer is **automatically exited** from the campaign.

<Warning>
**Mid-Cycle Exit Impact**

If a customer exits **in the middle of a cycle**, they will:

- **Lose all progress** made in that cycle.
- The cycle will still **count toward their repeatability limit**, even if not completed.
</Warning>

**Widget Behavior**

1. The customer is ineligible and has not earned the streak. The campaign is **hidden** from the widget.
2. The customer has already earned the streak at least once -- the badge remains **visible in the widget** with an **"Achieved"** status. Any progress in the current cycle is **lost**.

### Repeatability

**New Limit is Higher**

- Customers can **rejoin** the campaign if they are still eligible under the updated limit.

**New Limit is Lower**

- All customers are **re-evaluated**.
- Customers who have already reached or exceeded the new limit will be **automatically exited** from their current cycle.

<Warning>
**Mid-Cycle Exit Impact**

If a customer is exited **mid-cycle** due to the limit change:

- They will **lose any progress** made during that cycle.
- The cycle will still **count toward their repeatability limit**, even if no reward was earned.
</Warning>

### De-activate

- Customer progress is **saved**.
- Any actions performed while the campaign is inactive **will not** be counted toward the streak.

### Re-activate

Customers resume from the **last saved step**. Progress continues as normal.
