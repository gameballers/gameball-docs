## Intro

An interactive gamification tool that boosts engagement and brand awareness. Customers try to catch positive icons and miss bad ones to unlock rewards, driving interaction, visibility, and new revenue opportunities.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Boost Activity:** Encourage daily or weekly logins with regular gameplay and rewards to drive retention.
2. **Brand-Sponsored Challenges**: Brands can sponsor games, driving engagement and creating new revenue streams for Gameball customers.

## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Catcher** Template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Trigger**

- **On Widget:**
  Customers can access the catcher game through the **Badges** section in the widget. Tapping the badge redirects them to a screen where they can start playing and trigger the campaign to begin playing.

- **Deep Link:**
  Use the deep link to trigger the catcher campaign from a custom banner or button on your website or app. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**Audience**

- **Registered Customers:**
  Customers who have an account on your platform (signed up)

- **Anonymous Customers:**
  Visitors browsing anonymously without providing any contact information or identifiable details (not signed up)

  <Note>
  - Visitors can open the game, submit basic information through the lead form, play, and receive rewards, matching the standalone game URL experience.
  - Widget deep links that open a specific game work for guests as well. The widget would open directly into the game screen and allow participation without login.
  </Note>

- **Specific Customers:**
  You can choose for a specific selection of customers to participate in this campaign by filtering using segments, tags or customer attributes.

**Repeatability**

- By default, customers can play **once per day**. A new opportunity to replay it begins at 00:00 AM based on the chosen time zone.
- All Games campaigns support only the Limit per day/week/etc. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## Game Rules

**Dropping Items**

Go to **Customize Design -> Game** to set up the rules.

1. The game includes **items to catch** and **items to avoid** by default, and you can add up to 5 items each.
2. Customers must catch enough items and reach the required score **before the timer runs out**.

</Frame>

**Minimum items to collect & Time**

- Specify the minimum amount of items that should be caught to win before time runs out.
- Specify the duration (in seconds) during which the customer is allowed to play the game.

**Lives**

- To add difficulty, you can **limit the number of lives**. If customers lose more lives than specified by collecting bad items, they lose.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. Customers move the cursor to slide the basket left and right. Random items are dropping.
2. Customer tries to catch good items and must avoid bad ones to win.
3. The game ends when the time ends or when they lose a maximum number of lives.
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration when they earned a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner**
- **Intro / Main Screen**
- **Success Screen**
- **No Luck Screen**
- **Game General Rule Customizations:**
    - **Time Duration**: Set how long each game lasts (e.g., 10s, 20s, 60s).
    - **Mistakes/Lives**: Choose how many lives a customer has (e.g., 1, 3, or unlimited).
    - **Minimum Number of Items to Collect**.
    - **Tooltips**: Added help text explaining how time and lives impact gameplay.

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artwork.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Important Note

<Note>
**Customer Eligibility**

Games in the widget update dynamically based on customer eligibility, ensuring customers only see games they can still participate in.

**Games are hidden when customers become ineligible.**

If a customer no longer belongs to the game's target segment, the game is automatically removed from the widget and won't reappear unless eligibility is restored.
