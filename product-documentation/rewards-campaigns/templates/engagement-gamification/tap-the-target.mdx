## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Tap The Target** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Trigger**

- **On Widget:**
  Customers can access the game through the **Badges** section in the widget. Tapping the badge redirects them to a screen where they can start playing and trigger the campaign to begin playing.

**Audience**

- **Registered Customers:**
  Customers who have an account on your platform (signed up)

- **Anonymous Customers:**
  Visitors browsing anonymously without providing any contact information or identifiable details (not signed up)

  <Note>
  - Visitors can open the game, submit basic information through the lead form, play, and receive rewards, matching the standalone game URL experience.
  - Widget deep links that open a specific game work for guests as well. The widget would open directly into the game screen and allow participation without login.
  </Note>

- **Specific Customers:**
  You can choose for a specific selection of customers to participate in this campaign by filtering using segments, tags or customer attributes.

**Repeatability**

- By default, customers can play **once per day**. A new opportunity to replay it begins at 00:00 AM based on the chosen time zone.
- All Games campaigns support only the Limit per day/week/etc. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. Customers start playing by tapping the good items, such as gifts and stars, and ignoring the bad items, such as bombs.
2. Every time the customer taps a good item, they gain a score, and vice versa when they tap a bad item.
3. The game ends when the time ends.
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration, when they earn a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner**
- **Intro / Main Screen**
- **Game General Rule:**
    - **Time Duration**: Set how long each game lasts (e.g., 10s, 20s, 60s).
    - **Mistakes/Lives**: Choose how many lives a customer has (e.g., 1, 3, or unlimited).
    - **Tooltips**: Added help text explaining how time and lives impact gameplay.
- **Lead Form (if audience set to Anonymous Customers - Not logged in)**
- **Success Screen**
- **No Luck Screen**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

## Important Note

<Note>
**Customer Eligibility**

Games in the widget update dynamically based on customer eligibility, ensuring customers only see games they can still participate in.

**Games are hidden when customers become ineligible.**

If a customer no longer belongs to the game's target segment, the game is automatically removed from the widget and won't reappear unless eligibility is restored.
