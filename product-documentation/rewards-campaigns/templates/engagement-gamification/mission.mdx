## Intro

The **Mission Campaign** lets you define up to **10 different actions/tasks**. Once a customer completes _all_ tasks -- regardless of order -- they earn a reward and unlock a badge. It's perfect for onboarding flows, multi-step journeys, and targeted engagement.

**Use Cases:**

1. **User Onboarding**
   Complete "Create Account," "Verify Email," and "Place First Order".

2. **Complete Your Profile**
   "Upload profile picture", "Add address" and "Add payment method".

3. **Repeat Purchase Encouragement**
   "Place Second Order", "Purchase with min-value $100", and "Leave a Review".

4. **Milestone Engagement**
   "Make a $100 purchase," "Add 3 items to cart," and "Refer a friend."

## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Mission** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Tasks**

1. Add up to **10 tasks**
2. **Choose the Task Action:**
   You can define **an event** for each task, such as placing an order, visiting a product page, and so on.
3. **(Optional)** You can **add rules** for each event -- for example:
    - Specific order value
    - Specific product/category requirement
4. Configure each task content & Icon.

**Rewards**

Each task includes an optional **"Task Reward"** configuration.

</Frame>

- Task rewards can be configured independently per task.
- If no task reward is set, it only contributes to overall mission progress and no immediate reward is granted until the end of the mission.

**Repeatability**

- No repeatability option

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. The customer can start the mission by completing any of the required tasks (e.g., creating an account, placing an order).
2. They complete the remaining tasks in **any order** until all are finished.
3. They receive notifications after each task if event notification is enabled.
4. After completing all tasks, the customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
5. Missions are non-repeatable by default, so the reward can only be earned once per customer.

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Main Screen**
- **Success Screen**
- **Terms & conditions**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artworks.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Editing a Live Mission

Editing a live mission should be done with care to ensure a smooth experience for your customers. Below, we break down each scenario and its impact.

### Editing a Task

**Editing task Content:**

- If a customer changes (title, image, description), it is instantly updated for **all users**, regardless of progress.

**Editing Event:**

- If the user has already completed the task, their task remains marked as completed.
- If the task is not yet completed, the updated event/condition will take effect. Any progress already made will be preserved, and the user must fulfill the **remaining requirement** based on the new condition.

<Note>
**Example:**
Task: _Spend $1000 on Collection A_

- A user spends $500 before the customer updates the task to _Collection B_.
- The $500 spent is preserved, and the user must now spend the **remaining $500 on Collection B** to complete the task.
</Note>

### Deleting a Task

<Warning>
If a task is deleted, it will be removed for **all customers**, **regardless of their progress** -- whether completed or not.
</Warning>

**Impact on Customers In Progress:**

- If a task is deleted while some users are still in progress, the task will be removed from their task list. Their overall progress will be recalculated. If this were their **only pending task**, the campaign would be **marked as complete,** and the **final reward would be granted**.

**Impact on Analytics & Customer Activity:**

- Deleted tasks will continue to appear in both the analytics and customer task lists, but without a specific task number. They will be clearly labeled as "Deleted".

### Adding a New Task

- If the mission is **already completed**, the newly added task will **not appear** for the customer, and the mission will remain marked as **earned**.
- If the mission is **still in progress**, the new task will be **visible**, and the customer must **complete it** along with the others to earn the reward.

### De-activate

- Customer progress is **saved**.
- Any actions performed while the campaign is inactive **will not** be counted toward the campaign.

### Re-activate

Customers resume from the **last saved state**. Progress continues as normal.

### Task Overlap Handling

**A single customer action can fulfill multiple tasks at once.**

- For example, if a player makes a **$200 purchase with 5 items**, it can **simultaneously complete two tasks**:
    - _Task A: Spend $200_
    - _Task B: Buy 5 items_
