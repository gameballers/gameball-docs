## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Sliding Puzzle** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Trigger**

- **On Widget:**
  Customers can access the game through the **Badges** section in the widget. Tapping the badge redirects them to a screen where they can start playing and trigger the campaign to begin playing.

**Audience**

- **Registered Customers:**
  Customers who have an account on your platform (signed up)

- **Anonymous Customers:**
  Visitors browsing anonymously without providing any contact information or identifiable details (not signed up)

  <Note>
  - Visitors can open the game, submit basic information through the lead form, play, and receive rewards, matching the standalone game URL experience.
  - Widget deep links that open a specific game work for guests as well. The widget would open directly into the game screen and allow participation without login.
  </Note>

- **Specific Customers:**
  You can choose for a specific selection of customers to participate in this campaign by filtering using segments, tags or customer attributes.

**Repeatability**

- By default, customers can play **once per day**. A new opportunity to replay it begins at 00:00 AM based on the chosen time zone.
- All Games campaigns support only the Limit per day/week/etc. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. Customers must organize the puzzle from 1 to 15 to form the final picture.
2. They can only slide one piece of the puzzle in one direction.
3. The game ends when the puzzle is formed or when time ends.
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration, when they earn a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner**
- **Intro / Main Screen**
- **Game General Rule:**
    - **Time Duration**: Set how long each game lasts (e.g., 10s, 20s, 60s).
- **Lead Form (if audience set to Anonymous Customers - Not logged in)**
- **Success Screen**
- **No Luck Screen**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.
- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, timer, upload custom artworks, as well as the puzzle image.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Important Note

<Note>
**Customer Eligibility**

Games in the widget update dynamically based on customer eligibility, ensuring customers only see games they can still participate in.

**Games are hidden when customers become ineligible.**

If a customer no longer belongs to the game's target segment, the game is automatically removed from the widget and won't reappear unless eligibility is restored.
