Gameball Reward Campaigns often work as a powerful tool to engage customers in various ways. But each reward campaign is deployed on its own. In a special season, we know you sometimes want to deploy multiple reward campaigns as part of one theme. This is why Gameball has created the new Calendar Campaign.

The **Calendar Campaign** empowers you to create and manage multiple interconnected or independent campaigns, offering complete control over scheduling. Each campaign consists of **entities** (sub-campaigns), which can be customized based on your needs.

Customers will also find themselves ranking on a **leaderboard** that compares their performance and interaction with other customers who are also interacting with the campaign.

## How Calendar Campaigns Work

You can define the number of entities within a campaign, making it flexible for various durations and events. For example:

- **30 entities for a 30-day campaign** (e.g., a month-long challenge).
- **7 entities for a 7-day campaign** (e.g., Black Friday week).
- **3 entities for a 3-day campaign** (e.g., Eid festival).

To configure a calendar Campaign, you need to follow the steps.

To create a Calendar campaign, from the left bar, choose **Reward** under **Campaigns**. Click **Create New Reward Campaign**.
