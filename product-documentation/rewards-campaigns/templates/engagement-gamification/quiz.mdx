## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click **Add Reward Campaign**
3. Select the **Quiz** template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click **Set Live**

**Trigger**

- **On Widget:**
  Customers can access the quiz through the **Badges** section in the widget. Tapping the badge redirects them to a screen where they can start playing and trigger the campaign to begin.

- **Deep Link:**
  Use the `#gameball-quiz` deep link to trigger the quiz campaign from a custom banner or button on your website or app. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**Audience**

- **Registered Customers:**
  Customers who have an account on your platform (signed up)

- **Anonymous Customers:**
  Visitors browsing anonymously without providing any contact information or identifiable details (not signed up)

  <Note>
  - Visitors can open the game, submit basic information through the lead form, play, and receive rewards, matching the standalone game URL experience.
  - Widget deep links that open a specific game work for guests as well. The widget would open directly into the game screen and allow participation without login.
  </Note>

- **Specific Customers:**
  You can choose for a specific selection of customers to participate in this campaign by filtering using segments, tags or customer attributes.

**Repeatability**

- No Repeatability
- The quiz can only be played once per customer.

**Platform Visibility**

You can choose whether the game campaign is shown on web, mobile, or both, giving you better control over engagement strategies across platforms.

## Quiz Setup

**Questions**

- Minimum: **1 question**
- Each question must include:
    - The question text
    - An **optional image**
    - At least **1 answer** should be added
    - One **correct answer** must be selected

**Timer**

- Question Timer (**Optional**)
- At the end of configuring your questions, you can enable a timer that applies to each question individually (e.g., 10 or 20 seconds per question).
- This helps increase challenge and customer engagement.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. Customers are presented with a set of questions.
2. Customers will earn the reward only if they answer all questions correctly.
3. Getting 0 answers right is always considered failure, and the customer will receive the "No Luck" widget screen. Customer must answer **All** questions right for them to win.
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration, when they earn a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Customization

**Design & Content**

You can fully customize each stage of the campaign through dedicated tabs representing the different screens in the flow:

- **Banner**
- **Intro / Main Screen**
- **Questions Screen**

    **Game General Rule:**
    - **Time Duration**: Set how long each game lasts (e.g., 10s, 20s, 60s).
    - **Mistakes/Lives**: Choose how many lives a customer has (e.g., 1, 3, or unlimited).
    - **Default Values**: Existing defaults remain if no customization is made.
    - **Tooltips**: Added help text explaining how time and lives impact gameplay.

- **Success Screen**
- **No Luck Screen**

For each screen, you can tailor the following elements:

- **Branding**: Adjust background colors, text colors, and upload custom artworks.
- **Content**: Edit the headlines, descriptions, and call-to-action messages to match your tone and messaging.

This allows you to create a fully branded, on-theme experience that aligns with your business identity.

## Important Note

<Note>
**Customer Eligibility**

Games in the widget update dynamically based on customer eligibility, ensuring customers only see games they can still participate in.

**Games are hidden when customers become ineligible.**

If a customer no longer belongs to the game's target segment, the game is automatically removed from the widget and won't reappear unless eligibility is restored.
