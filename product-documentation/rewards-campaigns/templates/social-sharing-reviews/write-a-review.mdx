## Intro

Shopify Flow is a powerful automation tool that lets you seamlessly connect Gameball Loyalty with other Shopify apps. Use it to build custom workflows and enhance your loyalty program in multiple ways.

**Use Cases:**

Use Shopify Flow templates to reward customers on Gameball based on actions from other apps -- for example, leaving a review on Yotpo.

A Shopify Flow workflow consists of three main parts: **Triggers**, **Conditions**, and **Actions**. [Learn more in the full guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

**Trigger**

**On Shopify Flow**

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Apps** > **Shopify Flow** and click **Create Workflow**.
2. Choose the app you use for review as the trigger (e.g Yotpo).
3. **Add the customer email** if the trigger doesn't pass the customer identifier automatically. See the important notes below for more details.
4. Add the **"Reward a Campaign"** action and paste the **Campaign ID** you copied from the campaign details page.
5. **Save the workflow** to activate it.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. **Customer leaves a review** (e.g., via Yotpo).
2. **Shopify Flow triggers the workflow** based on the review response.
3. **Gameball rewards the customer** with the reward set in the "write a review" campaign.
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration when they earned a reward. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign).

## Important Notes

<Note>
**Skip Email Field**

When setting up Gameball as an action in Shopify Flow, you may not need to fill in the email field if the trigger app already passes the customer identifier automatically. In this case, the identifier will appear just above the email field.
