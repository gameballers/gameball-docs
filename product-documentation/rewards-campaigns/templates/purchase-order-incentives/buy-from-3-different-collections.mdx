## Intro

Encourage product discovery and increase average order value by rewarding customers who shop across multiple collections. The **_Buy from 3 Different Collections_** campaign is perfect for cross-selling and promoting variety in customer purchases. By targeting collection diversity, you can guide customers to explore more of what your store offers.
