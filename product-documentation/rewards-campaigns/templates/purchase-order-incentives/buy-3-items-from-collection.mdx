## Intro

Drive deeper engagement with your product collections by rewarding customers who buy multiple items from a specific collection. The **_Buy 3 Items from a Specific Collection_** campaign is ideal for promoting seasonal ranges, product bundles, or themed collections, encouraging customers to add more items to their cart and increase their order value.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer places an order that includes **three items from the same collection**.
2. Gameball automatically triggers the reward.
3. The customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign)

## Important Notes

<Note>
**Same Collection Requirement**

All three items must belong to the **same configured collection** to trigger the reward.
