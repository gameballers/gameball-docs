## Intro

Use the **Buy X and Get Y** campaign to reward customers for purchasing high-priority products while encouraging them to return and shop again. By offering a valuable reward in the next order, you not only boost sales of key items but also drive repeat purchases and build stronger customer loyalty.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer **places an order** that includes the configured product/s.
2. Gameball automatically triggers the reward as a coupon used on the next order.
3. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign)

## Important Notes

<Note>
**Reward applies to next order**

While this is a Buy X Get Y campaign, the **Y item is delivered as a coupon** that the customer can redeem in their next order.
