## Intro

Encourage larger purchases by rewarding high spenders with a **free shipping coupon**. With the _Free Shipping for Orders Over $500_ campaign, customers who place a qualifying order receive a free shipping coupon to be used on their **next purchase** -- a smart way to drive repeat orders and improve customer satisfaction.
