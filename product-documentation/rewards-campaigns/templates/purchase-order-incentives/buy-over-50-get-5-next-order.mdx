## Intro

Encourage higher-order values and repeat purchases with the **_Buy Over $50 and Get $5 on the Next Order_** campaign. This setup is perfect for motivating customers to spend more now in exchange for a clear reward they can redeem later, helping you boost both short-term revenue and long-term retention.
