## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer reaches a **total spend of $1000** over any number of purchases.
2. Gameball automatically triggers the reward.
3. The customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign)

## Important Notes

<Note>
**Cumulative Spend**

The **$1000** spend is calculated cumulatively across all orders. It does not need to be a single transaction.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Accumulated Spending Logic**

When using the "**Accumulative Total**" operator and setting the "**Times**" field to a value like **2 or 3**, the trigger must be fulfilled **that many times**.
For example, if the condition is spending $1000 and the Times field is set to 2, the customer must spend $1000 twice (a total of $2000) to earn the reward.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Starts from Activation Only**

The accumulation begins **only from the moment the campaign is set live**. Any orders placed **before** activation are **not counted** toward the total spend.
</Note>

<Info>
**Using Other Operators ( = or >= )**

If you change the operator to **=** or **>=**, the customer must reach the specified spend in one order.
</Info>
