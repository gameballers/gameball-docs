## Intro

Rewarding customers after completing five orders is a powerful way to acknowledge loyalty and encourage continued engagement. Reaching five purchases is a clear indicator of strong satisfaction with your brand, and a reward at this stage helps build emotional connection and long-term retention. It's a great opportunity to reinforce habits and turn regular customers into true brand advocates.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer places **5 orders** after the campaign is activated.
2. Gameball automatically triggers the reward.
3. The customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign)

## Important Notes

<Note>
**New Orders Only**

Only customers who place five new orders **after** the campaign is activated will be rewarded.
</Note>

<Note>
**No Retro Rewarding**

Orders placed before the campaign is activated will **not** be counted. The customer must place **five new orders after activation** to receive the reward.
</Note>
