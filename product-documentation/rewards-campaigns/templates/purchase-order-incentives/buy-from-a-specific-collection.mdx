## Intro

Use the **_Buy from a Specific Collection_** campaign to promote entire product categories by rewarding customers who shop from selected collections. This is a great way to boost seasonal sales, highlight new arrivals, or push slower-moving inventory by creating targeted incentives for collection-based purchases.

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer **places an order** that includes at least one product from the configured collection.
2. Gameball automatically triggers the reward.
3. The customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
4. The customer is notified via the widget or email, depending on your configuration. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign)

## Important Notes

<Note>
**Collection-Specific Only**

The reward will only trigger if the customer's order includes a product that belongs to the **specified collection/s**.
</Note>

<Note>
**Multiple Collections**

- You can add several collection IDs if you want to reward purchases that contain products from **all** the configured collections.
- To do this: Click **Add Rule -> Select Collection ID -> Choose "Equals" -> Enter the Collection ID** for each collection you want to include.
- The reward will only trigger when the customer's order includes at least one product from **every collection ID** listed in the campaign setup.
</Note>
