## Intro

Rewarding customers for creating an account is one of the simplest and most effective ways to encourage sign-ups and kick off user engagement. This campaign is ideal for driving account registrations, reducing bounce rates, and starting the customer journey on a high note.

## Creation Experience

**How to Set Up**

1. Open Gameball
2. Click Add Reward Campaign
3. Select Create account template
4. Edit the campaign's setup
5. Click Set Live

**Trigger**

The customer creates an account on your platform

**More Setup**

This template uses the standard reward campaign setup. See the [Generic Setup Guide](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/setup-reward-campaign) for details.

## End User Experience

**How it works**

1. A customer visits your platform.
2. When they **successfully create an account**, Gameball automatically **triggers the reward**.
3. The customer receives the reward immediately (points, discount, badge -- based on your setup).
4. The customer will be **notified** via the widget or email with the reward as per your configuration.

## Important Notes

<Note>
**New Customers Only**

Only customers who sign up _after_ the campaign is active will be rewarded.
</Note>

<Note>
**Old Customers**

You can manually reward customers who signed up before by going to the **Customers tab -> Reward a Campaign -> Account Created**.
</Note>

<Note>
**Bulk Migration**

Importing customers while the campaign is active won't trigger rewards.
</Note>

<Warning>
**[Shopify] New Account Creation Method**

Customers registering this way are marked as **"Member"** and will receive the reward.

**[Shopify] Guest Checkout**

Customers who check out as guests (Legacy method on Shopify) are labeled **"Guests"** and will **not** earn the reward, even if guest rewards are enabled.

**[Shopify] Guest to Member**

If a guest later registers with the same email, their status will be converted to **"Member,"** and they will receive the signup reward.
</Warning>
