Collecting emails from visitors who haven't signed up yet is essential as it opens more channels of communication between you and potential customers and it helps you take initiative that might convert visitors into customers.

Here are the pop-up campaigns ready-to-use templates currently available.

## Subscribe to Newsletter (for Shopify Users)

Encourage customers to give you their emails as approval for their subscription to your newsletter. Once the customer writes down their emails, they will automatically be marked as subscribed on Shopify. You can customize a reward that is convenient for this approval. For example, you can reward them with 10% off for doing so.

- **Actions Required:**

    - Choose Your **Audience**. Choose the audience for the campaign from the following options:
        - All customers (This includes Anonymous and Registered visitors)
        - Anonymous customers only
        - Registered customers only
        - Specific customer segments

    - Set a delay to your **Trigger** if needed. Select when the pop-up should appear:
        - Immediately (Default)
        - After a delay: you can specify the number of seconds for the delay (e.g., 5 seconds).

        <Note>
        - **Display frequency:** The pop-up will be shown **once per session.** This means that the customer will not be seeing this more than once unless they completely close their browser and open it in a new session.
        - If a customer is eligible for more than one newsletter subscription campaign, they will only be rewarded the first time they give their email address.
        </Note>

- **Customize your Pop-up:**

Create the content, look and feel of the pop-up so that it is clear and helpful.
