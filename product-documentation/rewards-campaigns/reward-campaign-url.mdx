## Campaign URL Options

The URL may either open directly for customers to play the game or prompt a lead form to identify the customer first, depending on the selected audience.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/campaign-url-options.png" alt="Campaign URL options" />
</Frame>

| Case | Details |
|------|---------|
| **1. Audience: Registered / Specific Customers** | The URL will contain a customer ID placeholder `{customerid}`. Replace `{customerid}` with the actual customer value or your dynamic variable. The customer is automatically identified and enters the game directly. Example: `https://play.gameball.app?k=xxx&p={customerid}&d=details_spin_123` |
| **2. Audience: Anonymous** | No ID is passed in the URL. The customer will see a form requesting their Email or Mobile Number before playing. You can customize the lead form from the customization page. Example: `https://play.gameball.app?k=xxx&d=details_spin_123` |

**Notes for Registered/Specific audience:**
- If the URL is missing the ID, the game will not load.
- If the customer ID passed in the URL doesn't exist in Gameball, we will create a new customer account.
- Customers are created as **members**.

**Notes for Anonymous audience:**
- You can set whether the customer identifier field on the form is **Email** (default) or **Mobile.**
- If the customer fills out the form and does not already exist in Gameball, a new customer account will be created.
- Customers are created as **guests**.

## Lead Form Configuration (When Audience is Anonymous)

When a customer accesses the Campaign URL, a form will appear to collect their information.

You can access it from **Customize Design > Lead Form**

<Note>[Shopify] The lead form is only available for Shopify customers.</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/campaign-url-lead-form-customization.png" alt="Lead form customization" />
</Frame>

The lead Form gives you more flexibility and control over the customer data you collect from guest users. You can enrich the Lead Form with your own **custom customer attributes**, allowing you to gather more meaningful information beyond the standard fields.

</Frame>

- **Lead Form supports 5 custom customer attributes:** You can include any previously created customer attributes, such as City, Gender, Favorite Product, Age, and more, using a multi-select dropdown. Custom fields display with the correct input type (text, number, date picker, toggle) and follow all validation rules.
- **Control over field configuration:** Rearrange fields, mark them as mandatory or optional, and toggle default fields (Name, Email, Mobile) on/off. Email or Mobile can be selected as the unique identifier, and unique identifiers cannot be removed or set as optional.
- **Smart data handling for guest users:** All submitted attributes are saved to the guest's temporary profile and automatically mapped to their customer profile once they are identified (e.g., login or purchase).

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Optional. A field to collect the customer's name. |
| **Email** | Default identifier. A field to collect the customer's email. Required unless Mobile is selected as the identifier. |
| **Mobile** | Can be enabled and set as the primary identifier instead of Email. Mobile numbers are stored in **E.164 international format** `+[Country Code][Number]` (e.g., `+1XXXXXXXXXX`). |
| **Terms and Conditions** | Optional. A checkbox to confirm customer agreement. |

<Warning>
**If Channel Merging is enabled and the mobile number is used as the unique identifier across all customer channels:**

- When a GB customer creates an account for their player, they must use the same mobile number format we use in the lead form. **Format:** `+[country code][area code][number]` **Example:** For Egypt: `+201xxxxxxxx`
- If the customer provides the mobile number without following this format (e.g., missing the `+`), a new account will be created instead of linking to the existing one.
</Warning>

**What happens if a registered customer fills out the lead form?**

If an already registered customer filled out the lead form, Gameball will add the missing data to their profile and ignore the already collected data. For example, a registered customer fills out the lead form, providing their name, email address, and phone number.

Gameball checks and finds out that this is, in fact, a registered customer and that it already has their name and email filled, but it has no phone number. Gameball will only add the phone number to their stored profile data and will not overwrite the name and email, as this information has already been previously collected.

## Important Notes

<Info>
**Replace Customer ID**

When using a URL with a customer ID, make sure to replace `customerid` with the actual customer value or your dynamic variable.
</Info>

**Change Language**

- You can change the game language to any of the configured languages by passing the `lang` attribute in the URL (e.g., `?lang=ar` for Arabic).
- If the `lang` parameter is not passed, the game will open using the widget's default language.
- You can update or manage your available languages from **Widget Settings > General > Languages**.

## Automatically Trigger Game Popups Based on Page URL

Surface Gameball Games on websites by automatically launching a game in a pop-up when a customer visits a specific page. This allows you to deliver game-based engagement experiences without requiring customers to open the Gameball widget.

### Automatic Game Popups

Games such as Spin the Wheel, Slot Machine, and Match Cards can now be triggered automatically when a page URL matches predefined rules. The experience opens directly in a standalone pop-up rather than inside the widget.

</Frame>

### Game Pop-Up Experience

The game pop-up provides a streamlined, distraction-free experience by displaying only the game interface without any widget navigation elements. Customers can play the game or close the pop-up at any time, and it will automatically close once the game is completed or dismissed. Guest users will see the game alongside a lead form, while logged-in customers access it according to their eligibility criteria.

### URL Rules and Display Controls

You can configure where the game pop-up appears using the same flexible URL rule engine as Web Popups. The pop-up can be set to display on all pages where the widget is installed or only on pages that match specific conditions, such as "contains," "does not contain," "is," "is not," "starts with," or "ends with." You can also control how often it appears -- either once per session or a limited number of times. Additional timing options allow the pop-up to show immediately on page load, after a delay, or once the customer scrolls a defined percentage of the page.

### Eligibility Behavior

The pop-up will not appear for customers who are no longer eligible to play the game, such as those who have reached a daily or lifetime limit. When multiple campaigns share the same trigger conditions, the system prioritizes the campaign that was created first.
