Gameball now supports engaging customers with gamified campaigns, even if you use your own loyalty program. You can leverage Gameball's campaign engine while sending external rewards -- like points, cashback, or physical gifts -- directly through their existing systems.

Gameball now offers a new **External Reward (API Call)** option directly within campaign rewards.

This new feature allows you to:

- Connect your loyalty program without any additional backend development.
- Reward customers with external benefits (points, cashback, physical goods, etc.) using a customizable API payload.
- Speed up campaign activation and reduce technical dependencies.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>This feature is available for campaign rewards only. It is not supported as a redemption method.</Note>

## Test API

Test API call configurations directly while setting up **Reward Campaigns** or **Automation Triggers**, ensuring your integrations work correctly before activation.

</Frame>

When configuring an API call in a reward campaign, click **"Test API"** to send a sample request and view:

`Response: 200 OK - Connection successful`

This makes it easier than ever to validate your setup confidently before going live.
