Let's say you have the cashback set up for your customers to gain 1 point for every pound that they spend, but on certain occasions, you want to reward your customers with more than one point, let's say for example, on Black Fridays. This is where the **Point Multiplier Reward Campaign** comes into play. It's a campaign that you set on certain dates that multiply the number of points that a customer earns when they complete a purchase.

Let's explore the step-by-step process of creating and configuring a **Point Multiplier** reward campaign from scratch.

## Creating a New Point Multiplier Reward Campaign

- Log in to your **Gameball Dashboard**.
- Navigate to the **Campaigns** section on the left side menu and click on **Rewards**.
- Choose **Points Multiplier Reward** under the **'Start from Scratch'** Section.
- Give your new campaign an **internal name** for your team, and then start the configuration.

## Configuration of a Point Multiplier Reward Campaign

### Step 1: Rule

Define the rules that determine when customers receive the campaign's rewards. Utilize Gameball's event-based engine to create sequences of rules that customers must follow to earn rewards.

#### Audience

Choose who is eligible to view and participate in this campaign:

- All Customers
- Specific Customers:
    - Segments
    - Tags
    - Customer Attributes
    - Combination of Segments, Tags, or Customer Attributes

After choosing the campaign's audience, you will be able to view the number of customers that are currently eligible to participate in this campaign.

#### Trigger

For Points Multiplier rewards, the trigger is automatically set to the event "Place Order." You now have two options to configure this campaign:

1. **Apply the Points Multiplier to All Orders**: By default, the multiplier will apply to every order placed by your customers.

</Frame>

2. **Apply the Points Multiplier to Specific Collections or Product SKU**: If you only want to apply the multiplier to a specific collection or a product (e.g., during a sale or promotion), you can add a rule that includes the collection's ID. This way, the multiplier will only be applied to orders that include items from that particular collection or the product alone.

<Warning>
This feature (editing rules) is available on the **Enterprise** & **Guru** plans only.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Activation Settings

Choose when this campaign will be available for your customers:

1. **Always Active**: The campaign will always be available for its audience unless you deactivate it.
2. **Scheduled**: The campaign will have a certain **start date** and **end date**. Before and after these dates the campaign will not be visible to the audience.

</Frame>

### Step 3: Rewards & Badges

Select the multiplier for the points customers will earn during the campaign. Choose to **double (2x)**, **triple (3x)**, or increase **fivefold (5x)** the points customers receive for every dollar spent on their orders.

Now that you have created and configured your campaign, remember to press **Save**, **Preview**, and then **Activate** your campaign.

### Custom Expiry for Points Multiplier Campaigns

Set a configurable expiry period for points earned through point multiplier campaigns. This gives you full control over when bonus points are activated (respecting your return window) and when they expire, helping reduce fraud risk and liability.

#### Why This Matters

Previously, points earned from multiplier campaigns (e.g., Double Points) were **activated immediately** without considering your return/refund window. This exposed merchants to:

- **Fraud risk**: customers could earn and use points before returning items.
- **Inflated liability:** from early activation of bonus points.

With this update, you can now:

- Delay **point activation** until after the return window passes.
- Define a **custom expiry period (days)** for multiplier campaign points, just like in other reward campaigns.
- Align rewards with **finalized, eligible transactions** only.
