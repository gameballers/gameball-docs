Rewarding your customers is a powerful way to drive engagement, increase loyalty, and boost sales. In this article, we'll introduce the different types of Reward Campaigns and highlight our ready-made templates designed to help you engage, acquire, retain, personalize, grow, and celebrate special occasions with your customers.

## Types of Reward Campaigns

There are two ways you can create reward campaigns on Gameball:

- **Start from scratch:** Customize a campaign from the beginning.
- **Use a Template:** Ready-to-use templates that help you serve specific goals.

## Start a campaign from scratch

To start creating a campaign from scratch, you will need to pick one of the following campaign types:

### Action-Based Reward

Rewarding customers based on specific actions they take, such as making a purchase, referring a friend, or completing a survey. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-action-based-reward-campaign).

### Time-Based Rewards

Rewarding customers on certain dates or occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays, creates a sense of exclusivity and appreciation. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-time-based-reward-campaign).

### Points Multiplier Rewards

Multiplying the points earned by customers when they make a purchase, previously known as **Cashback Campaigns**, incentivizes spending and drives repeat purchases. [Learn more](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-point-multiplier-reward-campaign).

### [Shopify] Shopify Flow Rewards

Create custom rewards triggered by specific actions on apps connected to Shopify Flow, letting you tailor rewards for unique actions like social engagement. [Learn More](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/gameball-on-shopify-flow).
