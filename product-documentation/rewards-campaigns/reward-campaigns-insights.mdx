Reward campaigns are an essential tool for engaging customers, increasing your revenue, and driving desired behaviors. To effectively measure the performance of these campaigns, it's crucial to analyze various metrics that provide insights into their effectiveness.

## Where to find Insights for every reward campaign

To get data about the performance of any of your created reward campaigns, from the left bar, click **Rewards** under **Campaigns**. Then choose any created campaigns from the list.

## Insights Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the **key metrics available** for you to evaluate the performance of your reward campaigns:

### Campaign Completion Rate

This metric measures the percentage of customers who successfully completed the campaign compared to the total number of customers the campaign was sent to. It is calculated using the **equation**:

**Number of customers completed the campaign / Total number of customers the campaign was sent to.**

### Campaign Abandonment Rate

The abandonment rate is the inverse of the completion rate and represents the ratio of customers who abandoned the campaign without completing it.

### Distinct Customers Count

This metric indicates the total number of unique customers who participated in the campaign.

### Total Customer Count

The total times customers participated in the campaign. It represents the overall level of engagement generated by the campaign.

### Total Rewarded Points

### Total Rewarded Coupons

Similar to points, this metric represents the total number of coupons distributed as rewards during the campaign.

### Total Rewarded Points Value

## Funnel Analytics Insights

**Game Funnel Analytics** is an insights module that gives you a clear, step-by-step view of how your customers interact with every game campaign, across all game types, entry methods, and user types.

This new funnel helps you understand where customers engage, where they drop off, and how effectively your game campaigns drive conversions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/rewards-campaigns/insights-funnel-analytics.png" alt="Funnel analytics overview" />
</Frame>

### Where can you find it?

**Unified Funnel Tracking for All Game Types**

Game Funnel Analytics now supports **all Gameball games**, including:

- Spin and Win
- Slot Machine
- Scratch Card
- Memory Match
- The Catcher
- Quiz
- All Games (funnel-only insights added)

Both **guest customers** (via lead form) and **registered customers** are fully tracked.

Supported entry methods:

- Widget
- Deep link / direct URL
- Popup trigger
- Manual open

### Funnel Stages Tracked

Each game campaign now includes a consistent set of funnel steps:

1. **Game Shown** - Triggered only when the game auto-displays via a pop-up.
2. **Lead Captured** - Captured when a guest customer submits the lead form.
3. **Game Opened** - When a customer opens the game from any entry point.
4. **Game Started** - When the customer clicks "Play".
5. **Game Completed** - When the game animation/logic finishes, regardless of the outcome.
6. **Rewarded** - Displays how many customers received a reward.
7. **No Luck** - Customers who completed but did not receive a reward or lost.

### Each stage shows:

- Total customers
- Conversion rate to the next step
- Drop-off visualization
- Filtering aligned with the campaign's date filter

**Key metrics:**

- **Total Participated** = top-most tracked event.
- **Goal Completed** = customers who reached the last tracked step.
- **Total Conversion** = Completed / Started.

## Conversion and Drop-Off Logic

- **Step Conversion:** Example: 1,000 opened -> 750 started = 75% conversion.
- **Step Drop-Off:** 25% dropped between "Opened" -> "Started."
- **Overall Conversion:** 1,000 opened -> 200 reached the goal = 20% overall conversion.

The report is designed to clearly demonstrate the value of Gameball's services in enhancing your business, highlighting how the campaign positively impacts engagement and revenue. Further, it helps you implement strategies to re-engage your customers with the campaign's configuration page, such as notifications, reminders, or incentives, especially after initial configuration.
