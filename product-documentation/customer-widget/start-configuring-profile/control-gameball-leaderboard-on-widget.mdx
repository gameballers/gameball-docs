Leaderboards could be a great tool to create a competitive environment and to encourage your customers to be more active; however, leaderboards could also be demotivating if deployed within the wrong crowd. Gameball gives you the option to use it or to completely remove it when it is not convenient.

## How does Gameball leaderboard work?

The leaderboard lets the customer track their progress and compare it to all your other customers.

The customer will be ranked based on their progress according to the [method of Tiering up](/product-documentation/admin-settings/tiering-up-methods) that you have configured in the Tier program. For example, if you chose "Amount Spent" to be the tiering up method, the customer will be ranked based on the amount they spent in comparison to other customers' spending.

To view the leaderboard, the customer needs to click on the **Progress bar** or the **Tier** found on the home section of the widget, then switch to the **Leaderboard tab.** The customer will then see their rank amongst other customers.

## How can a customer know their exact rank?

Customers can see their rank in comparison to the rest of the customers in the text above the customer list.

They can also filter the rank list according to:

- Today
- Yesterday
- This week
- Last week
- This month
- Last month
- This year
- All-time

## How to show or hide the Gameball leaderboard from the widget?

Hiding the leaderboard requires only a few steps. On the **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, go to **Widget > General: Visibility**. Under the **Leaderboard Tab,** check **Show** or **Hide** based on your objective, then click **Save**.
