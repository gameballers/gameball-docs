description: "Learn about the three different stages that help you control the presence of Gameball widget on your platform."

There are different ways to control your customer's interaction with the widget, starting from entirely eliminating the widget to only hiding the button.

Here are the three different through which you can control the Gameball widget:

## Stage 1: Publish and unpublish Gameball loyalty experience

By toggling the switch at the top right of any page on **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, you will be able to activate or deactivate Gameball loyalty experience.

Once toggling to unpublish, your customers will no longer find the Gameball widget on your platform. Any actions like purchases done by your customers during the time Gameball is inactive will still reflect on Gameball; however, your customers will not be rewarded for their activity.

<Note>
When the Gameball program is switched to unpublished, any customer event will still reflect on their profile on the dashboard; however, they will appear dimmed as these actions will have no consequence.
</Note>

Once you switch it back on, the widget will appear again on your platform, and your customers will start getting rewarded again.

## What happens when you deactivate the program by switching off the toggle?

When you disable Gameball:

- Your loyalty program will **not** be visible to your customers.
- Your customers will **not** earn rewards.
- Your customers will **not** receive any messages, notifications, or emails.
- Your customers' actions will be added to Gameball.
- Your customers will be able to use coupons they had already claimed before disabling the program.

<Warning>
- Gameball will still be receiving any actions when the toggle is deactivated. **However**, no changes will take place as a result of these player actions.
- Publishing Gameball means that your customers will be able to see the Gameball widget (if the widget is not hidden), and they will start getting rewards based on the designed loyalty experience.
</Warning>

## Stage 2: Hiding and unhiding Gameball widget

You can completely hide Gameball's widget without deactivating the loyalty program, which means your customers will still be rewarded for their interaction; however, they will not be able to track their progress or find anything related to the configured loyalty program.

To only hide the widget, go to **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, click **Widget > General: Visibilty**, choose whether to display or hide Gameball widget by checking **Show** or **Hide** under **Customer** and **Guests**, then click **Save**.

## Stage 3: Hiding and unhiding Gameball widget button

Lastly, you can choose between hiding or displaying the Gameball Launch button on your platform. Suppose there is no space for the Gameball launch button on your platform, or none of Gameball's available buttons match your brand theme. In that case, you can simply hide it and let other inline buttons or any other interactive elements open the Gameball widget.

To only hide the button, go to **Gameball Admin Dashboard**, click **Widget > Launcher: Shape**, choose the **Hide** option to hide the Gameball launch button, then click **Save**.

Now, the Gameball button will no longer appear on your platform, so make sure to use our [Deep Links](/product-documentation/customer-widget/player-profile-tabs/enable-opening-gameball-widget-through-inline-links-using-deeplinks) if you still want your customers to access the widget from a different place on your platform.
