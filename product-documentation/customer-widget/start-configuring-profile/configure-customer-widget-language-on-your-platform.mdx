Your account must have a default language. The data under this default language will be displayed to your **customers** whenever any additional active language has missing data.

However, you can still add and activate **more than one language** on your account.

## How to add an extra language?

Click on **Add Language** next to "Additional Languages." Then choose the second language, and click **Add.**

Make sure to **Save** your changes.

## What will happen after adding an additional language?

Once you add a new supported language to your Gameball account in addition to the default one, all fields across the system that are shown to your customers through the widget will display an additional input field for the newly added language.

See the example below for how the level name field appears when two languages are active (left) versus when only one language is active (right):

## What fields will be affected once you add a new language?

Once you add a new supported language to your Gameball account in addition to the default one, the following fields will require corresponding data in the newly added language:

- **Score name**, if you are using Score as the leveling-up method
- **Points name**
- **Level name**
- **Challenge name and description**
- **Guest view intro and button text**
- **Referral tab title and description**
- **Message title, body, and button text**
- **All system notifications**

<Warning>
In case you are adding a new language after finishing the experience design and configurations, you will need to update all the above fields one by one to add the corresponding data for every field.
