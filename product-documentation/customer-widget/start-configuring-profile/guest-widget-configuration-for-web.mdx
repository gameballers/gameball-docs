For **Web only**, when you have a guest visitor, Gameball does not create a profile for the customer until guests signup on your platform. Once your guest logs in or create an account, Gameball creates a profile for them and they start getting enrolled in Gameball rewards experience through the widget.

Below is an example of how the guest view widget looks like for your guest visitors:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/customer-widget/guest-widget-preview.png" alt="Guest widget preview example" />
</Frame>

You can access the guest view configurations in **Gameball Admin Dashboard** through **Widget** > **Branding: Guest**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/customer-widget/guest-branding-configuration.png" alt="Guest branding configuration section" />
</Frame>
