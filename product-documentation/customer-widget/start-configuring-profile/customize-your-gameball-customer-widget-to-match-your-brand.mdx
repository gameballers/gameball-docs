When your loyalty widget feels out of place on your platform, customers may perceive it as intrusive or untrustworthy. That's why customizing the widget to align with your brand's identity is essential for increasing engagement and trust. Here are detailed steps for how to customize your entire widget to match you brand's theme.

## Colors

To brand your Gameball customer widget to match your website or app, go to the **Gameball Admin Dashboard** and navigate to **Widget** **> Branding: Colors**

Use the color palette to choose a color that matches your platform theme either by hovering over the palette with your cursor and then clicking on the closest color to your platform. Or for more accurate branding, type down your brand's color code, and click **Save**.

### Uploading an Image as a Widget Icon for Guests

One of the things that directly affect the branding is the main widget icon that shows on the guest landing page of the widget. You can choose an icon that represents your idea of loyalty without drifting from the platform's main theme.

To change the main guest widget icon, though the **Gameball Admin Dashboard** go to **Widget > Branding: Guests**

<Frame>

</Frame>

Under **Image**, choose between the following:

- **Default Image:** Leave Gameball's default icon as it is.
- **Upload Image:** Upload your own image from your own library to match your theme.
- **None:** Leave the guest widget without an icon.

<Note>
When choosing **"Upload Image,"** the image size and type must be: 280px*280px. JPEG or PNG.
</Note>

Paste the Website link where customers can create a new account.
