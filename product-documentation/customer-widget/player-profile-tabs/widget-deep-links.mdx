If Gameball's traditional widget button does not match your theme, or you don't have a space for it, you no longer have to depend on Gameball's button to let your customers and guests access Gameball loyalty widget. You can [hide and replace the button](/product-documentation/customer-widget/start-configuring-profile/hide-widget-button), or add new elements that allow your customers to quickly access any section of the widget from any part of your platform.

## Understanding Deep Links

Deep links are URLs or hyperlinks that take users directly to a specific section of the Gameball widget. This allows for a more seamless user experience by providing quick access to the desired content without navigating through the entire widget.

## Using Deep Links

You can use deep links with any element that can hold a hyperlink, such as text, images, menu items, or buttons. You can also include these hyperlinks in automated emails or SMS campaigns. For example, if a customer clicks a button labeled "Check your earned points now!" in an email, they will be redirected to your website and see the widget section displaying their points.

## Available Gameball Deep Links

Here are the deep links Gameball provides to help you customize your user experience:

- `#gameball-home` – Takes customers to the home section and guests to the sign-up section.
- `#gameball-referral` – Directs customers to the referral tab and guests to the home section.
- `#gameball-faq` – Opens the "FAQ" section for both customers and guests.
- `#gameball-levels` – Shows customers the levels progress tab and guests the levels program section.
- `#gameball-redemption` – Leads customers to the redemption tab and guests to the "How to Redeem" section.
- `#gameball-wheel` – Opens the "Spin the Wheel" page for customers.
- `#gameball-slot` – Opens the "Slot Machine" page for customers.

<Warning>
When embedding any widget page to a button on the menu bar, use the deep link in this format: `#gameball-home`. Do not use the full URL format like `https://(home page)/#gameball-home`.
</Warning>

- **Wheel Page**: `#gameball-wheel` for direct access to the wheels page.

## Using Deep Links in Emails and SMS Campaigns

To redirect users from an email or SMS to your website and open the Gameball widget to a specific section, you need to use a query string. Combine your website link with the Gameball widget deep link.

For example:

- **Website URL**: `www.shop-name.com`
- **Gameball Widget Home Section**: `/#gameball-home`
- **Gameball Widget Referral Section**: `/#gameball-referral`
- **Gameball Widget FAQ Section**: `/#gameball-faq`
- **Gameball Widget Levels Section**: `/#gameball-levels`
- **Gameball Widget Redemption Section**: `/#gameball-redemption`

For example, if you want your customer to press a button on the link that takes them to the homepage of your website and opens up Gameball's referral section, the link would be as follow: [www.shop-name.com/?gameball-deep=referral](http://www.shop-name.com/#gameball-referral)
