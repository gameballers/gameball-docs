## Explore the Gameball Widget Features

Learn about the different sections and features your customers can access directly through the Gameball widget.

The Gameball widget provides your customers with a centralized space to track their progress, redeem rewards, engage with your loyalty program, and more. Here's an overview of each section they will find inside the widget:

### Points Section

This section displays the customer's current points balance and its equivalent monetary value.

### Earn Tab

Customers can explore how to earn more rewards. This tab includes:

1. Cashback Section: Shows how customers earn points through purchases.
2. Badges Section: Displays all earned and unearned challenges that have been customized for the customer. It also includes progress indicators and status updates for each challenge.

### Play & Win Tab

Play & Win is a widget section that displays all active game campaigns in one place.
It helps customers quickly discover games and clearly separates games from standard earning actions. The section appears automatically when at least one game is active and disappears when no games are available.

### Redeem Tab

Here, customers can exchange their collected points for different types of discount coupons or other available rewards.

### Levels Tab

This tab shows the customer's current level, the upcoming levels they can unlock, and the benefits and rewards associated with each level.

### Referral Tab

Gameball's referral feature allows customers to refer your platform to their friends. Once a referred friend signs up, the referring customer receives rewards. The more friends they refer, the bigger the rewards they can earn.

### Transaction History

Customers can view the full history of their points activity, including how and when they earned or redeemed points.

You can now use a **new deep link** to open the Gameball widget directly in the **Customer History** section.

**Deep Link Identifier:** `#gameball-history`

**Use Case:** Include the link in your message campaigns:

"Check your latest rewards here: [YourWebsite.com#gameball-history](http://YourWebsite.com#gameball-history)"

### Notifications Tab

A log of real-time updates related to the customer's progress, such as earning a badge or reaching a new level.

### Activated Game Campaigns

If any game campaigns are activated, such as Spin the Wheel, they will appear as interactive sections within the widget for the customer to engage with.
