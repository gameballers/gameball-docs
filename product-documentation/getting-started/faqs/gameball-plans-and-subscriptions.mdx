  <Accordion title="How Are Gameball Rewarded Players Calculated in the Pricing Plan?" icon="calculator">
    Gameball charges you based on the actual rewarded customers. Your rewarded customers are the users that are enrolled in the rewards programs and have points.

    <Note>
    Rewarded players that do not have any points do not take part in the calculations.
    </Note>

    Each pricing plan is restricted to a limited number of rewarded users and when this number is exceeded, you will be additionally charged per each rewarded customer. Check the rate per extra rewarded customer [here](https://app.gameball.co/signup).

    For example, the **Pro** plan supports up to 5000 rewarded customers a month. When the number of rewarded customers exceeds 5000, a charge of $0.02 will be added per each extra customer above 5000.

  <Accordion title="What Happens Upon Uninstalling Gameball?" icon="trash-can">
    When uninstalling Gameball, all program configurations are going to be deleted instantly without possible reverse, consequently, this cancels your subscription.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Happens When Downgrading a Gameball Plan?" icon="arrow-down">
    Each pricing plan has a limited set of features. When you downgrade from one plan to another, you lose all the extra features you had in your previous plan, however, you will still have access to all configurations done within your plan.

    For example, if you downgraded from Pro to Free. The Free plan allows four challenges and two levels only, when downgrading, all other configurations that exceed the four challenges and two levels will be deleted.
