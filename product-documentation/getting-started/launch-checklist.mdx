If you are new to Gameball and do not know where to start to create an ultimate loyalty experience for your customers. Here is a checklist of the essential steps you might want to start with:

## For Shopify Users: Enable Customer Account Creation

- If you are a Shopify user, you need to give your customers the ability to create their own accounts and enroll in your Gameball rewards experience. [Learn more](/product-documentation/getting-started/faqs/enable-customer-account-creation-on-shopify)

- You can also make sure that the customers' points and tiers are updated by following the steps in [this article](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/your-customers/migrate-your-customers-to-gameball-from-other-loyalty-programs-on-shopify).

## For Non-Shopify Users: Import Your Customers

If you have been using other loyalty programs and you want your customers' profiles migrated, then follow the steps in [this article](/product-documentation/guides-strategies-faqs/supportive-guides/import-customers-csv) to import the customers' data to Gameball.

## Setting Up and Activating Gameball Programs

Gameball offers four programs that help you reach your goal from the loyalty system, whether that is an increase in acquisition, activation, engagement, loyalty, etc.

In a few steps, you can configure and activate any of the following programs:

- [Earn Points and cashback](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-earn/launch-and-configure-your-earn-pointing-system)
- [Redeem Points](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system)
- [Referrals](/product-documentation/programs/referral-program/launching-referral-program)
- [Reward Campaigns](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/reward-campaign-intro)
- [VIP Tiers](/product-documentation/programs/vip-tiers/configuring-gameball-vip-tiers)

## Setting Up the Redemption Rules

After setting up your loyalty programs, you will find that you are able to reward your customers with points and other gifts when they enroll in any of your configured programs. These points can, later on, be redeemed in the form of discount percentages, coupons, free shipping, etc.

Make sure you set the right methods and rules of redemption. [Learn more](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system)

## Customize Your Widget

- Start by creating a widget profile. Set up some general widget settings such as language, program name, tabs' visibility, icons, etc. [Learn more](/product-documentation/customer-widget/introduction-to-customer-widget)

- Your loyalty widget does not have to be incompatible with your platform's theme. You can easily style Gameball's widget to match it with your store's theme and make it seem like it is an inseparable extension of your brand.

## Activate Your Ready-to-Use Loyalty Program

Now that you have configured the most essential parts of your loyalty program, do not forget to activate and launch your widget on your platform so that your customers can enroll in your configured reward experience. All you need to do is publish the Gameball widget by following "Stage 1" in this article.
