### **4. Lead Form is Now Available for** Scratch & Win

**Platform:** Non-platforms Only | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

When you want to launch a campaign for all your customers, registered or not, you can do so by selecting "Anonymous" as your Audience for the campaign. By doing so, your customer will have to fill out a **lead form** if they want to enroll in the game and win.

Scratch & Win campaigns now support guest and anonymous customers by using the campaign URL. You can now easily collect leads by enabling the lead form for non-logged-in customers. [Learn more about how to create and customize your scratch & win lead form.](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/scratch-and-win)

**Note that** the lead form is only available if you have set your **Audience** to "Anonymous Customers - Not logged in."

### **5.** Lead Form: Terms & Conditions Link Support

Adding to what we explained in the previous feature, you can add an "Agree to the terms and conditions" requirement before submitting the form. What we have new, however, is that you can now add a Terms & Conditions link directly in the lead form. Customers can review your terms by simply clicking the link, improving compliance and transparency for your lead collection process.

To customize your lead form, select **Scratch & Win, Slot Machine,** or **Spin the Wheel** campaign template > Set your Audience to **Anonymous** > Click Customize Design > go to **Lead Form** tab

From there, you can scroll down to **Terms and Conditions** and follow the stated format to create a hyperlink: `{Link text[[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)]}`

## **Core & Platform**

### **New Saudi Riyal Symbol Support in Arabic Widget View**

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

We've introduced support for the **Saudi Riyal currency symbol (﷼)** in Gameball's widget, specifically when the widget is displayed in **Arabic** and **Saudi Riyal** is the selected currency.

### Use Case & Value

**Localized Experience**: Ensures your customers in Saudi Arabia see the correct and culturally familiar currency representation when engaging with your loyalty widget.

### How to Enable

1. Go to **Settings > Admin Settings > General > Currency**
2. Click **Edit**
3. Select **Saudi Riyal** as your currency
4. Check the box: **"Display currency as a symbol."**
5. Ensure your widget is set to Arabic

## **Other Improvements**

### **Option to Hide Trophy Icon in Widget**

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

You can now hide the trophy icon and default status text in the widget when Level and Referral cards are disabled. This helps keep the widget clean and aligned with brand design when only the Points Balance and Earn/Redeem cards are active.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### How to do this?

Navigate to Widget > General > Visibility Tab, the option will be shown only in case the Tier and Referral cards are set to hidden.
