We've introduced a new built-in event, `points_redeemed`, that automatically triggers whenever a customer redeems points. This enables deeper tracking, better automation control, and easier integration with external systems like CRMs or analytics tools.

## **Other Improvements**

### **1. Enhance Customer Coupons API to Identify Promotions and Display Promotion Rules**

We've enhanced the **Customer Coupons API** to make it easier for apps and storefronts to distinguish **automatic promotions** from **regular coupons** and to display the **promotion rules** that define how customers can qualify for each offer. [Read more](/product-documentation/coupons/creating-coupon-manually).

#### **What's New**

- Added a new boolean flag:
  - `"isPromotion": true`
  - `isPromotion = false` → Regular or manually issued coupon.
  - `isPromotion = true` → Promotion or rule-based discount (e.g., "Buy 2 Get 1 Free", "50% Off Collection").

- Added a new object for **promotion details**:
  - `"promotionRules": {"type": "Buy X Get Y","description": "Buy 2 items from Summer Collection, get 1 free T-shirt","conditions": {"buyQuantity": 2,"getQuantity": 1,"applicableCollections": ["Summer Collection"],"minOrderValue": 0}}`

- Includes:
  - Promotion type and description
  - Applicable collections or products
  - Minimum order value or eligibility rules

### **2. Responsive Game View for Standalone Game URLs**

We've enhanced the **standalone Game URLs** to support a fully **responsive layout**, ensuring that Gameball games now look and perform beautifully across all screen sizes, from mobile and tablets to desktop and large touchscreen displays.

#### **What's New**

- **Responsive Game Display**
  - Games like _Spin the Wheel_, _Slot Machine_, and _Match Cards_ now automatically scale to fit any device or screen resolution.
  - Perfect for public activations, malls, events, or in-store experiences on large touchscreens.

- **Adaptive Layout Behavior**
  - The game's design and lead form now adjust dynamically to the available space.
  - Proportional scaling ensures visuals and animations remain sharp and centered.

- **Preserved Widget Experience**
  - When a game is played **inside the Gameball widget** (e.g., on a website or app), it retains its original mobile view for consistency.

#### **Why It Matters**

Marketers and event organizers can now launch engaging Gameball experiences anywhere, without worrying about layout or display issues. Games will look great and perform smoothly, whether accessed on a phone or a 24" touchscreen kiosk.

### **3. Improved UX for Customer List in Campaigns**

We've enhanced the **Customer List** tab under campaigns with a new **loading skeleton** (shimmer effect) for a smoother and more intuitive experience.

#### **What's New**

**Visual Feedback While Loading:**

- A shimmering placeholder now appears while the customer list data is being fetched.

**Consistent Look & Feel:**

- The skeleton layout matches the existing table structure across the dashboard, including row spacing and shimmer style.

**Always Active on Fetch:**

- The loading skeleton is triggered during:
  - Initial page load
  - Pagination or data refresh

#### **Why It Matters**

This improvement prevents confusion between "no data" and "still loading," providing users with clear feedback and a more polished, responsive dashboard experience.
