#### **How does it work?**

With A/B Testing, you can:

- **Split audiences into groups** (A & B) with a fully customizable ratio (e.g., 50/50, 70/30).
- **Build distinct automation paths** for each group with different actions, rewards, or communications.
- **Ensure stable testing** with random but consistent customer assignment to each group.
- **Measure performance side by side**, with detailed reporting on engagement, redemption, and revenue uplift for each branch.
- **Optimize your strategy** by identifying which path performs better and scaling it across your campaigns.

#### **Why it matters**

This new capability gives marketers complete control to **experiment, validate, and refine engagement strategies**, ensuring you always choose the approach that drives the best results for your business.

A/B Testing is now live and ready to use inside the **[Automation Builder](https://app.gameball.co/automation)**.

### **2. Games Hidden in Widget Breaking Offline Links**

We've fixed an issue where **hiding games from the widget** caused problems when accessing the **offline game link**.

- Previously: If a game was hidden in the widget, opening it via its offline link would appear broken.
- Now: Games will **work seamlessly via offline links**, even if they are hidden from the widget.
