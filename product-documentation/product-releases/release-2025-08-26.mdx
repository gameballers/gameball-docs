## **Core & Platform**

### 1. Dynamic Value for Fixed Coupon Rewards

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

We've enhanced the **Fixed Coupon Rewards** by introducing a **Dynamic Value option**. Instead of being limited to a static reward (e.g., $10 off), you can now configure fixed coupons to dynamically calculate their value based on a percentage of a chosen variable (e.g., **15% of Value X**). [Learn more about how to set up each Reward type.](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/faqs/understanding-rewards-types)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/dynamic-fixed-coupon-rewards.png" alt="Dynamic fixed coupon rewards" />
</Frame>

#### Use Case

This update gives you more flexibility in creating promotions that scale with order size or customer actions. For example:

- Instead of always giving $10 off, a merchant can now set the coupon to equal **15% of the customer's cart total or a specific metadata value**, making offers more personalized and impactful.

#### Key Highlights

- **Dynamic Option Added to Fixed Coupons**
  - You can select whether a fixed coupon has:
    - A **static fixed value** (e.g., $10).
    - A **dynamic value** (percentage of a chosen metric).
- **Flexible Promotions**
  - Easily adapt offers to cart totals, order values, or metadata-driven actions.
- **Seamless Setup**
  - No changes required in workflow, just configure the value type when setting up your fixed coupon rewards.

### 2. Coupons Start & End Date

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

We've added **Start and End Date options** for coupons, giving you full control over when your coupons are active. This ensures promotions run only during intended time frames and automatically expire when no longer valid. [Learn more about creating a new coupon](/product-documentation/coupons/creating-coupon-manually).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/coupons-start-end-date.png" alt="Coupons start and end date" />
</Frame>

#### Use Case

This update makes coupon campaigns more efficient and prevents manual intervention. For example:

- Launch a coupon that starts automatically on **Black Friday** and expires at the end of **Cyber Monday**.
- Set seasonal coupons (e.g., valid only for the December holiday shopping season).
- Prevent outdated coupons from being used after a promotion ends.

### Key Highlights

- **Start Date** → Merchants can define when the coupon becomes valid.
- **End Date** → Coupons automatically expire on the set date.
- **Automation** → No need to manually activate or deactivate coupons.
- **Consistency** → Works across all coupon types (fixed, dynamic, third-party, etc.).

**_Note:_** _Coupon start and end dates are only available when the campaign is **scheduled**._

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/copy-campaigns-workspaces.png" alt="Copy campaigns across workspaces" />

   - The audience will always be set by default to **All Audience**, even if the original had filters/exclusions.

We've added a new **Boolean customer attribute** to help you identify whether a customer was referred by another customer or acquired through other channels. [Learn more](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/customer-profile/customer-profile-attributes)

#### API Enhancements

- A new field `isReferred` is now included in the `customerAttributes` object for:

### 6. Full Control Over Internal Gameball Events

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** Dashboard → Integrations / Event Settings

You now have the ability to **enable or disable the internal events** that Gameball automatically fires (such as `place_order`, `view_product`, `order_refunded`, `add_to_cart`, etc.) [Learn more about creating and sending events to Gameball](/product-documentation/admin-settings/create-and-send-events).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/control-internal-events.png" alt="Control internal Gameball events" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

This gives you **complete control** over the events you track and process, allowing you to:

- Eliminate unnecessary or duplicate events.
- Customize your tracking to fit your business logic.
- Decide which events should (or shouldn't) be fired to your system.

#### Key Details

- A **dedicated settings page** now lists all auto-fired Gameball events with toggles (Enable/Disable).
- Changes apply **in real time**; once an event is disabled, it stops being fired immediately.
- When disabled, the event will no longer:
  - Be sent to your system.
  - It is used in internal Gameball flows (unless you manually fire it).
- **Permissions:** Only Admins, Workspace Owners, or Workspace Admins can control event toggles. If custom roles are enabled, this action is assignable.

### 7. Custom Expiry for Points Multiplier Campaigns

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All

You can now **set a configurable expiry period** for points earned through **point multiplier campaigns**. This gives you full control over **when bonus points are activated** (respecting your return window) and **when they expire**, helping reduce fraud risk and liability. [Read about points multiplier campaigns](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/start-from-scratch/create-point-multiplier-reward-campaign).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/custom-expiry-multiplier.png" alt="Custom expiry for points multiplier" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

Previously, points earned from multiplier campaigns (e.g., Double Points) were **activated immediately** without considering your return/refund window. This exposed merchants to:

- **Fraud risk**: customers could earn and use points before returning items.
- **Inflated liability:** from early activation of bonus points.

With this update, you can now:

- Delay **point activation** until after the return window passes.
- Define a **custom expiry period (days)** for multiplier campaign points, just like in other reward campaigns.
- Align rewards with **finalized, eligible transactions** only.

#### How It Works

1. **Set Expiry in Campaign Setup**
   - While creating/editing a **Point Multiplier Campaign**, you'll see a new **Expiry (days)** field.
   - Accepts only numeric values (Min: 1 day, Max: 365 days).
   - Required field.

2. **Activation Logic**
   - Points (base + multiplier) are **activated only after the program-level return window ends**.
   - Ensures no points can be used during refund eligibility.

3. **Expiration Logic**
   - Once activated, points expire after the **custom expiry period you set** (e.g., 30 days).

4. **Validation & Errors**
   - If expiry is missing or invalid, you'll see an error message before saving.

### 8. Automate "Points to Expire" Notifications

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

You can now configure automations using a **"Points to Expire" trigger**. This gives you full control over **when and how to notify customers about their expiring points**, helping you drive engagement while reducing liability. [Learn how to create an Automation Campaign](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/how-to-create-an-automation-campaign).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/points-to-expire-automation.png" alt="Points to expire automation" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

Before today, Gameball had been sending fixed **points expiration notifications** by default. This was rigid and offered limited flexibility.

With this update, you get:

- **Custom timing** for expiry reminders (e.g., 30, 15, 7 days).
- **Multi-channel communication** (Email, SMS, Push, Webhook).
- **Full control** (no expiry notifications will be sent unless you set up automations).

#### How It Works

1. **New Trigger: "Points to Expire"**
   - Available in the **Automation Builder**.
   - Detects when a customer's points are **approaching expiration**.
   - Let's you define a **custom timeframe** (e.g., 30, 15, 7, or X days before expiry).

2. **Available Actions**
   - Choose one or more actions to notify customers:
     - Send Email
     - Send SMS
     - Send Push Notification
     - Send Webhook

3. **Flexible Automation Flows**
   - Create multiple automations for different timeframes (e.g., a reminder 30 days before and a final reminder 7 days before).
   - Add **conditions** like "only trigger if expiring points ≥ 50."

4. **Message Customization**
   - Use dynamic placeholders in templates:
     - #{{customer_name}}
     - #{{expiring_points}}
     - #{{expiry_date}}
   - Tailor your messages per channel.

5. **Execution Logs & Reporting**
   - Gameball logs each automation execution.
   - You'll see which customers were targeted and what actions were performed.

6. **Important Change ⚠️**
   - The old **Points Expiry Notifications** section has been removed.
   - No expiry notifications will be sent **by default** unless you configure this automation.

7. **Premade Template**
   - A ready-to-use automation template is available.
   - Mimics the previous expiry notification behavior for quick setup.

## **Other Improvements**

### 1. New Security Enhancement: reCAPTCHA Added to Login Flow

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All

We've strengthened the **Gameball login flow** by introducing **Google reCAPTCHA** as an additional layer of protection.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/recaptcha-login.png" alt="reCAPTCHA on login" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

To ensure your account remains secure, reCAPTCHA helps safeguard against automated login attempts and unauthorized access, keeping your data and your customers' data safer.

### Key Details

- reCAPTCHA is now integrated into the **dashboard login screen**.
- Users may be asked to complete a quick verification before accessing their account.
- This measure helps block **bots, brute force attacks, and malicious login attempts**.

- For all **Purchase/Order** and **Refund** events sent to MoEngage, the payload now includes:

##### 2. Customer Attributes

- New attributes are added when syncing customers with MoEngage:

- **Currency** → Uses the **existing workspace currency setting**, always sent as a **3-letter currency code** (e.g., USD, EGP).

##### 4. Condition

- These fields are included **only if** the workspace has both country and currency configured **and** MoEngage integration is enabled.

#### Why This Matters

With this enhancement, MoEngage users can:

- Segment customers by **geography**.

**Platform:** All (with Multi-Workspace enabled) | **Plan:** Available for all plans supporting MoEngage | **Channel:** MoEngage Integration

We've enhanced our **MoEngage integration** to include **workspace context** in both customer events and attributes, giving you greater flexibility in segmentation and personalization. [Read about Gameball on Moengage](/product-documentation/apps-integrations/moengage-integration).

#### Use Case

For clients managing multiple workspaces, this update makes it possible to **segment and target customers in MoEngage based on the specific workspace** where their activity or data originates.

#### Key Highlights

   - All customer events sent to MoEngage now include an additional property:
     - **`gameball_workspace`**: a string containing the workspace name or ID.
   - This field will be present across **all events** fired to MoEngage.

2. **Customer Attributes Update**
   - A new customer attribute has been added:
     - **Gameball Workspace**: a string attribute storing the associated workspace.
   - This allows MoEngage users to filter and segment customers directly by workspace.

3. **Condition**
   - These new fields are **only included if the client is using a workspace-enabled setup** (multi-workspace account).
