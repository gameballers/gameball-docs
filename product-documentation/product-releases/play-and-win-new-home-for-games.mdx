---

We've introduced a new Play & Win section in the Gameball widget to make games easier to find, easier to understand, and more engaging for customers. Instead of appearing alongside regular earning actions, all game-based campaigns now live in one dedicated place.

## What Is the Play & Win Section?

**Play & Win** is a new widget section that displays all active game campaigns in one place. It helps customers quickly discover games and clearly separates games from standard earning actions. [Learn about the Gameball Widget](/product-documentation/customer-widget/introduction-to-customer-widget).

The section appears automatically when at least one game is active and disappears when no games are available.

## What This Means for Your Customers

- Games are easier to discover and access
- All games are grouped in one dedicated section
- Each game appears as its own card with a banner, description, and icon
- The newest games appear first by default

## Supported Game Types

All existing and upcoming game campaigns are supported, including:

Spin & Win, Slot Machine, Scratch & Win, Quiz, Puzzle, Match Cards, Shooter, Tap the Target, Stamps, and more.

Each campaign appears as a **separate card**, even if multiple campaigns use the same game type.

## What Existing Gameball Customers Need to Do

If you already have game campaigns:

- **Nothing changes immediately.**
  Your existing games will continue to appear under the **Earn** section.

- **When you edit an existing game campaign**, you'll be asked to add or update the game's banner through the [customization](#customizing-how-games-appear) section.

  </Frame>

  - This step is required to support the new Play & Win experience.
  - Once completed, the game will automatically move from **Earn** to **Play & Win**.
  - You can then control the visibility of this section of the widget by deciding to show or hide it. Note that hiding it will mean campaigns do not exist for your customer as they con't access it.

  - When you have multiple game campaigns customized, you will be able to control how they appear in the section as well as their order from the **play & win options** tab under the General widget section in the dashboard. [Learn how to control the order and card layout of the play & win section in the widget](/product-documentation/customer-widget/start-configuring-profile/customizing-tabs-visibility-and-order-in-gameball-widget-settings).

This allows you to transition to the new layout when you're ready, without unexpected changes.

## What New Gameball Customers (or New Campaigns) Need to Do

For new accounts or newly created game campaigns:

- Adding a **banner** is required during setup
- Games will appear **only** in the **Play & Win** section
- Games will no longer appear under **Earn**

This ensures a clean and consistent widget structure from the start.

## Customizing How Games Appear

To customize a Game's Campaign banner, from your dashboard, go to the desired campaign, click **edit**, then **Customize Design**.

Stay on the **Banner** tab. You can customize each game's:

- Short description
- Banner image

All changes are reflected in the widget automatically and support multiple languages, based on your widget's language settings.
