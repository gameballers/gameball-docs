## Key Highlights

### 1. Stamps Campaign

**Platform:** Shopify, Salla, Others | **Plan:** Shopify & Salla: PRO+ | Others: Locked by default (Available as an Addon) | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

The Stamps campaign allows you to reward customers for completing a specific action multiple times in a row. It's a powerful way to boost repeat behavior and long-term engagement.

### 2. Exclude Taxes from Reward Calculations

**Platform:** All Platforms | **Plan:** By Request | **Channel:** All

We've introduced a new configuration option allowing you to **exclude taxes from reward calculations**, giving greater accuracy and control over how cashback or points are distributed. [Learn more about points redemption options](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-redeem/launch-and-configure-your-redeem-pointing-system).

### Business Use Case & Value

- **Financial Precision**: You can now reward customers based only on the **true product value**, excluding tax amounts.
- **Loyalty Accuracy**: Prevent over-rewarding by basing rewards on net purchases, not tax-inflated totals.
- **Global Compliance**: Especially valuable for regions with high or variable tax rates.

#### How It Works

- A **new toggle** is available under **Earn Settings**:
  - **Label:** _"Exclude Taxes from Reward Calculations"_
  - **Default:** Disabled
- When **enabled**, all rewards (Cashback, Points, etc.) will be calculated based on the **order subtotal before taxes**.

#### API Requirements

To enable this functionality, you must send the following fields in order-related APIs:

- `total_tax`: Total tax amount for the order.
- `taxes` (_per lineitem)_: Breakdown of tax amounts per item.

**_Important Note:_**

_If the tax data is **not provided** while the toggle is **enabled**, Gameball will:_

- _Default to using the full order amount (including tax)_

### 3. New API: Retrieve Coupon Lock Details

**Platform:** Enterprise | **Plan:** Clients Using our Couponing Engine | **Channel:** All

We've released a new API endpoint that allows you to **fetch detailed information about locked coupons**, giving more transparency and control over coupon management.

#### Use Case & Value

- **Operational Clarity**: Helps support, marketing, and ops teams understand **who has a locked coupon**, when it was locked, and other key metadata.
- **Issue Resolution**: Speeds up investigation and debugging related to coupon redemption and locking behavior.
- **Optimized Experience**: Enables you to proactively manage coupon lock durations, re-locking behavior, and customer-specific edge cases.

#### API Overview

- **Endpoint:** `GET /integrations/locks/{lockReference}`
- **Purpose:** Returns detailed info for a locked coupon using the `lockReference`.

##### Key Response Data Includes:

- **Associated customer** (`CustomerId`)
- **isUsed (**_Boolean_**)**
- **usedAt (**_timestamp_)
- **isExpired (**_Boolean_**)**
- **ExpiredAt (**_timestamp_)
- **coupons** _(List of all locked coupons under this reference)_

## Other Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Rewards Now Support Up to 3 Decimal Places

Dynamic Rewards now support multipliers with up to **three decimal places**, allowing for more accurate point distribution (e.g., 1.015 instead of 1.5).

**Example:** A $1000 spend with a 1.015 multiplier earns **1015 points**. [Learn more about rewards](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/faqs/understanding-rewards-types).

### 2. Improved Automation Reactivation Handling

Previously, deactivating an automation would remove all customers from it, causing a loss of their progress when the automation was reactivated. Now, customers' progress within the campaign is preserved. When a customer deactivates and later reactivates an automation, the system saves each customer's position in the flow, allowing them to continue exactly where they left off.

### 3. Game Lead Form Enhancements: Update only missing customer profile attributes

When using a game campaign with a lead form, previously, if a customer who was **already registered** submitted new data, that data was ignored. Now, Gameball uses only the newly entered data and adds it to the customer's profile, ensuring no existing data is overwritten.
