## **General New Features**

### **2. Automation:** Continuous Audience & Frequency Re-Evaluation

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

Previously, eligibility was checked only at the start of a new cycle when the trigger occurred. With the new feature, admins can now enable continuous re-evaluation before each step in the automation. If a customer becomes ineligible, they will be automatically exited from the flow. The feature is controlled via a toggle in the Automation Settings, defaulting to OFF. [Learn more about editing active automation](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/making-edits-on-active-automation).

## **Core & Platform**

### 1. Fixed Points Cashback Configuration Per Collection

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** Plans with Custom Collection-based Rules | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

We've introduced a **new cashback reward type** that gives you more flexibility in how you reward customers: Configure cashback rules to issue **fixed points per collection.** [Learn more about giving different cashback values for different collections](/product-documentation/programs/loyalty-points-earn/collection-based-earning-rules).

#### Use Case:

This feature is ideal if you want to offer **consistent point rewards per collection**, regardless of the product's price.

For example, if you sell exclusive items and want to reward 100 points per product in the "New Arrivals" collection, regardless of whether an item costs $20 or $200, you can now do that easily.

#### How It Works:

##### Configuration:

- While setting up or editing Custom Cashback Rules, you can now choose:
  - **Fixed Points (new)**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/fixed-points-cashback-collection.png" alt="Fixed points cashback per collection" />
</Frame>

#### API Requirements:

To enable this logic, you must send the following details **per item** in the Order API:

- Collection ID(s)
- Price
- Discount
- Taxes
- Product ID

#### Key Rules:

- If an item belongs to multiple collections → Gameball will reward based on the **highest fixed point value.**
- If multiple different items from the same collection are purchased → The fixed points reward applies per item.
- The **fixed points reward will still respect active Points Multiplier Campaigns.**
- _(Example: Double Points → 200 becomes 400)_

### 3. Upload Custom Earn and Redeem Icons for the Widget

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

[Read more about how to customize your widget to match your brand](/product-documentation/customer-widget/start-configuring-profile/customize-your-gameball-customer-widget-to-match-your-brand).

#### Use Case:

#### How to Configure:
