Take a look at what the Gameball product team has been working on recently.

## 1. Exported Files Include Customer Tags

**Platform**

All

**Plan**

All

**Channel**

All

You can now export **customer tags** along with your customer data directly from the Gameball dashboard.

### Why This Matters

Previously, exported customer files did not include tags, making it difficult to analyze or segment customer groups externally.

With this enhancement, your exported data is now **more complete and actionable**, allowing for deeper analysis in your CRM, BI tools, or spreadsheets.

### What's New

- The **Customer Export File** now includes a new column: **Customer Tags**.
- Each exported row displays all tags associated with the corresponding customer.
- Supports multiple tags per customer (comma-separated).

### Benefits

- Simplified segmentation and analysis outside Gameball
- Easy filtering by tag in external tools
- Improved data visibility for marketing and analytics teams

### How to Access

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Customers**.
2. Click **More →** **Extract**.
3. Your file will now include the new **Tags** column automatically.

You can now **download the CSV files for the currently uploaded collections and products** directly from your Gameball dashboard. [Learn more](/product-documentation/admin-settings/upload-products-collections-csv).

### Why This Matters

Previously, once a file was uploaded, there was no direct way to review or retrieve that same dataset.

This update helps you **quickly verify**, **audit**, or **reuse** your uploaded data without needing to re-export or recreate it manually.

## 3. Display Points Expiry Date in Customer Logs

**Platform**

All

**Plan**

All

**Channel**

All

You can now view the **expiry date of rewarded points** directly within each customer's profile logs. [Know more about the customer activity log](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/your-customers/customer-activity-log).

### Why This Matters

Previously, you had to manually cross-check multiple areas of the dashboard to determine **when specific reward points would expire**, making customer management time-consuming.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/points-expiry-date-logs.png" alt="Points expiry date in customer logs" />
</Frame>

### What's New

- Added a **"Points Expiry Date"** tooltip in the **Customer Logs** section.
- Each reward transaction now clearly displays its associated expiry date.
- Available for both automatically and manually rewarded points.

### Benefits

- Instantly identify when a customer's points are set to expire.
- Improve customer support accuracy and response times.
- Eliminate the need for external tracking or manual cross-checking.

### Example

When viewing a customer's reward history, you'll now see:

**+500 Points, Expiry Date: 2025-12-31**

This makes tracking active and expiring rewards easier than ever.

## 4. Deep Link to Open Customer History in the Widget

**Platform**

All

**Plan**

All

**Channel**

All

You can now use a **new deep link** to open the Gameball widget directly in the **Customer History** section, giving customers a seamless way to view their transactions, rewards, and points activity directly from any external communication channel. [Learn more about Gameball's customer widget](/product-documentation/customer-widget/introduction-to-customer-widget).

### Why This Matters

Previously, clicking on a Gameball link from an email, SMS, or push notification would open the widget's home page. With this update, you can direct customers **straight to their history**, improving engagement and user experience.

### What's New

- **New Deep Link Identifier:** `#gameball-history`
- When triggered, the widget automatically opens and navigates to the **History tab**.
- Works whether the widget is already open or closed.

### Example Use Case

Include the link in your message campaigns:

"Check your latest rewards here: [YourWebsite.com#gameball-history](http://YourWebsite.com#gameball-history)"

This instantly takes users to their in-widget transaction and reward history, no extra navigation needed.

## 5. Reorder Rewards in "Spin the Wheel"

**Platform**

All

**Plan**

All

**Channel**

All

You can now **reorder rewards** within your Spin the Wheel setup using a new **drag-and-drop interface**, giving you full flexibility to adjust how rewards are displayed on the wheel, without needing to recreate your entire setup. [Read about how to configure a Spin the Wheel campaign](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/spin-the-wheel).

### Why This Matters

Previously, once rewards were created, their order was fixed, making it difficult to fine-tune the visual layout or adjust how rewards appeared on the wheel. With this enhancement, you can easily change the order anytime to optimize user experience or reflect campaign updates.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/spin-wheel-reorder-rewards.png" alt="Reorder rewards in Spin the Wheel" />
</Frame>

### What's New

**1. Reordering Rewards**

- Easily rearrange existing rewards using a **drag-and-drop** interface.
- The new order is saved immediately upon confirmation.
- No need to delete or recreate rewards.

**2. Behavior & Display**

- The wheel preview updates in real time to reflect the new order.
- Only the **visual and positional order** changes, reward probabilities and configurations remain intact.

This update makes managing your Spin the Wheel campaigns more intuitive, visual, and flexible than ever before.

## 6. New Customer Attribute: **Referral Status**

**Platform**

All

**Plan**

All

**Channel**

All

We've added a new [customer attribute](/product-documentation/understanding-your-customers/customer-profile/customer-profile-attributes), **Referral Status**, to help you better track and segment referred customers based on their journey stage.

### Why This Matters

Previously, Gameball only indicated whether a customer _was referred_ (via the `is_referred` flag), but not _how far_ they were in the referral journey.

Now, you can easily distinguish between customers who were referred but haven't completed the required action ("pending") and those who have successfully completed it ("successful").

### How It Works

**New Attribute:** `referral_status`

| **Status** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| _(null)_ | The customer was not referred |
| `pending` | The customer was referred, but has not completed the referral action |
| `successful` | The customer was referred and completed the required referral action |

**Relation to Existing Attribute:**

- `is_referred = false` → `referral_status = null`
- `is_referred = true` → `referral_status = "pending"` or `"successful"`

### Where You Can Use It

The **Referral Status** filter is now available across all targeting tools:

- Segmentation
- Automation Campaigns
- Rewards Campaigns
- Communication Campaigns
- Redemption Rules
- Conditional Splits in Automations

### Example Use Cases

- Send reminder emails to **pending referrals,** encouraging them to complete their first purchase.
- Trigger bonus rewards or messages for **successful referrals**.
- Exclude **non-referred** customers from referral-specific campaigns.

This update enables smarter lifecycle management and more precise automation flows around the referral journey.

## Other Improvements

### 1. Removal of "Clicked" Tracking for Push Notification Campaigns

We've removed the **"clicked" tracking metric** from [push notification communication campaigns](/product-documentation/communication-campaigns/create-and-configure-mobile-push-campaigns) to ensure more accurate reporting and consistent data alignment across platforms.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/push-notifications-tracking-removed.png" alt="Push notifications clicked tracking removed" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

Previously, "clicked" tracking within push campaigns was inconsistent due to varying device and platform restrictions, which could lead to misleading engagement data.

#### What Changed

- The **"Clicked" metric** has been **removed** from push notification communication campaign analytics.
- Other key metrics remain available for full visibility.
- This change improves data accuracy and prevents reporting discrepancies between dashboards.

---

### 2. Improved Game Inner Page for Unsuccessful Attempts

We've updated the **game's inner page** experience to display a more accurate and intuitive state when a customer **does not win** a game.

#### Why This Matters

Previously, even when a customer didn't win, the post-game page could still display **success indicators** such as a checkmark or "Achieved" caption, causing confusion.

This enhancement ensures that the user experience clearly differentiates between **successful** and **unsuccessful** game outcomes.

#### What's New

- A new **failure/unsuccessful state design** appears when no prize or reward is won.
- Removed misleading success visuals (e.g., checkmarks or "achieved" text) for non-winning attempts.
- The message and visuals now better communicate that the attempt was not successful, while maintaining an engaging experience.

#### Benefits

- Clearer and more intuitive feedback for customers.
- Consistent game experience aligned with the outcome.
- Reduced confusion and improved visual communication.

---

### 3. Minimum Two Tasks Required for Missions

To ensure missions remain meaningful and structured, **all missions must now include at least two tasks by default**. This update improves the quality of engagement and prevents single-task missions that behave like basic actions instead of multi-step reward campaigns. [Learn about missions](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/templates/engagement-gamification/mission).

#### Why This Matters

Missions are designed to encourage progress, completion, and engagement through multiple milestones. Previously, some clients created single-task missions, which limited the purpose and analytics of mission-based experiences.

#### Benefits

- Encourages more engaging, goal-oriented missions.
- Prevents accidental creation of incomplete or trivial missions.
- Ensures consistency across all mission configurations.

This enhancement strengthens mission design quality and helps clients create more effective customer journeys within Gameball.

### 4. Filter by Gameball Source in the Automation Conditional Split

You can now use the newly added attribute **Gameball Source**, a new system-managed attribute that identifies _how_ a customer was created in Gameball (e.g., via API, widget, lead form, or POS) - in the conditional split of an automation. [Learn more about the Automations' Controls](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/automation-controls)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/gameball-source-attribute-automation.png" alt="Gameball source in automation conditional split" />
</Frame>

#### Why This Matters

Based on how the customer was created on Gameball, you can build different flows within the automation by using this new attribute in the conditional split operator.

#### How It Works

**New Attribute:** `Gameball Source`

- Automatically set by Gameball when a customer is created.
- Not editable or passed via API.
- Included in Customer APIs and Automation filters.

**Example Gameball Source Values:**

| **Creation Method** | **Source Value** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Lead Form | `lead_form` |
| Widget | `widget_creation` |
| Order API | `order` |
| Payment API | `payment` |
| Cashback Flow | `cashback` |
| Manual Migration | `manual_migration` |

---

### 5. Custom Expiry Added to Manual Transaction API

**Endpoint:** `POST /integrations/transactions/manual`

**Available for:** Developers using Gameball API v4

We've added a new optional field, **expiryAfter,** to the **Manual Transaction API**.

This lets you set a **custom expiry** for points added or deducted via the API, just like in the Gameball dashboard.

#### Example:

```json
{
  "playerUniqueId": "12345",
  "amount": 100,
  "expiryAfter": 60
}
```

#### How it works:

- **If not provided,** the default expiry rules apply.
- **If provided,** overrides the default expiry with your custom duration.
- **Accepted range:** 1–3000 days.

This enhancement gives developers **greater flexibility and control** over point expiration directly from their integrations.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Correct Display for 0-Point Rewards in Games

We've addressed an issue where **rewards worth 0 points** were incorrectly displayed as "No Luck" in the widget, even when a meaningful reward name was configured. This fix improves both the **dashboard setup** and **customer experience** for non-monetary rewards.

#### What's New

#### **1. Mandatory Reward Name for 0-Point Rewards (Dashboard)**

To prevent confusion, when setting up a reward with a value of **0 points**, the **Reward Name field is now mandatory**.

- If you attempt to save a 0-point reward without a name, you'll see a validation message:
  - _"Please provide a reward name for 0-point rewards."_
- This rule applies to all Gameball games, including **Spin the Wheel**, **Quiz**, and **Scratch Card**.

#### **2. Correct Display of 0-Point Rewards (Widget)**

Previously, customers who received 0-point rewards saw a "No Luck" message, even if the reward was intentional (e.g., for correct quiz answers).

- Now, the **configured reward name** will always be displayed.
- The system will only show "No Luck" if the reward was explicitly set to that.
- If a reward name isn't set (which shouldn't happen anymore), the widget will simply display "0 Points."

#### Why This Matters

This update ensures clarity and a more **authentic customer experience**, especially for non-monetary game setups or symbolic rewards where acknowledgment matters more than point value.

#### Affected Areas

- **Dashboard → Game Configuration:** Mandatory field validation for 0-point rewards.
- **Widget → Game Result Page:** Correct display behavior for all 0-point reward cases.

Your customers will now always see the right message that matches their action, no more "No Luck" when they actually succeed!
