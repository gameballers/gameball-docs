Take a look at what the Gameball product team has been working on recently.

## **1. The Catcher Game: A New Reward Campaign**

**Platform:** Shopify, Salla, Others | **Plan:** Shopify & Salla: PRO+ | Others: Locked by default (Available as an Addon) | **Channel:** Web, Mobile

[The Catcher campaign](https://app.gameball.co/campaigns/rewards/create?type=23) is an interactive gamification tool where customers collect specific items within a time frame to earn rewards. Avoiding unnecessary items is key, as each mistake costs a life. This campaign helps you engage customers, boost visibility, and increase conversions. [Try it yourself!](https://play.gameball.app/?k=f625e2144ad74d17a34c1b2c795aa8bd&d=details_catcher_79334&m=xa)

## **2. SMS Reminder for Expiring Points**
