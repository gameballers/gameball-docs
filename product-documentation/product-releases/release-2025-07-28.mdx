### 2. API & Secret Key Rotation from Dashboard

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

Gameball has introduced the ability for you to **rotate your API keys and Secret Key individually** directly from the dashboard, offering enhanced security without integration disruptions.

#### Use Case:

You can now **secure your accounts by rotating keys** without affecting your existing platform connections, helping them comply with security best practices (e.g., periodic credential rotation) and mitigate potential key exposure risks.

[Here is where to get your account integration details: API Key and Secret Key.](/product-documentation/admin-settings/get-api-keys)

#### Key Features:

- **Automated Updates for Shopify & Salla:**
  - Rotated keys are automatically updated in connected Shopify and Salla stores.
  - On these platforms, you do **not need to manually update** your store configuration after key rotation.

### 3. High Security Mode for API Authentication

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** Shopify & Salla: Not available | Others: Available | **Channel:** All

Gameball introduces **High Security Mode**, an optional feature that provides an extra layer of protection for your API integrations. When enabled, this mode ensures that all API requests are verified and secure, preventing unauthorized access and data exposure. This feature is disabled by default and can be easily activated in the Integration settings within the Admin panel. Once enabled, any integration that previously required only an API key will now also require a Secret Key, ensuring that even if the API key is exposed, it cannot be misused. [Learn more about APIs and Secret Keys on Gameball](/product-documentation/admin-settings/get-api-keys)

If you want to activate this security option, go to **Settings > Admins Settings > Account Integration**, then scroll down to switch the toggle under **High Security Mode**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/high-security-mode.png" alt="High security mode" />
</Frame>

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Security:** Protects against unauthorized access by ensuring that all API requests come from trusted sources.
- **Data Privacy:** Prevents potential exposure of sensitive data and ensures that no unauthorized requests can be made.
- **Improved Client Protection:** Ensures that client-side elements, like widgets, are secure by encrypting IDs, making it impossible to reverse-engineer or misuse them.

This update helps ensure that your integrations remain safe and reliable, giving you peace of mind and greater control over your data security.

### 5. Custom User Permissions Per Invitation

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

Gameball has released **Custom User Permissions**, giving Admins full control to configure dashboard access **per user individually** during the invitation process, without relying solely on preset roles. [Learn how to create and assign a new user role](/product-documentation/admin-settings/create-user-assign-roles).

#### Use Case:

Businesses often have team members with distinct roles, such as marketing, finance, or CX. Now, Admins can easily grant each user **precisely the permissions they need**, improving data security and operational control.

#### Key Features:

  - **Hide**: Section hidden from the user.
  - **Disabled**: The user can view but not edit it.
  - **Allow**: User has full access (including create/delete, where applicable).

- **Permissions Configuration UI:**
  Permissions options are presented during invitation via toggles or radio buttons for each key section:
  - Customers
  - Campaigns
  - Coupons
  - Analytics
  - Settings
  - Notifications
  - Integrations
  - Billing
  - And more…

## **Other Improvements**

### 1. "Has Value" Operator Added to Automation Condition Split

**Platform:** All | **Plan:** All | **Channel:** All

We've added a new **"Has Value"** operator to the Condition Split node in Automations, allowing you to check if a specific customer attribute is **not empty**. [Learn more about automations](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/introduction-to-automation-campaigns).

<Frame>

Splitting flows more precisely, for example, trigger one branch if a mobile number exists, and another if it's missing, enabling more dynamic and tailored automation logic.
