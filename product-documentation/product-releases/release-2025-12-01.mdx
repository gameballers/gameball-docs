All

We introduced an advanced Budget Control system that allows you to define, monitor, and enforce spending limits for reward-based campaigns. This provides tighter cost governance, clearer visibility, and automated safeguards against overspending.

#### **Key Capabilities**

##### **Set a Total Budget During Campaign Creation**

- Budget Control can be enabled when creating a new campaign.
- The entered amount becomes the campaign's **Total Budget**.
- Budget always uses the **workspace currency** and cannot be changed.
- Depending on the reward type, additional configuration fields appear to ensure accurate cost evaluation.

##### **Validation Rules**

- A budget is required if the feature is enabled.
- Negative values and non-numeric entries are not accepted.

##### **Activation and Deactivation Logic**

##### **Turning Budget Control ON for an Active or Previously Active Campaign**

- Tracking begins from the moment Budget Control is enabled. **Budgets are not retroactive**, and past spending is excluded.

##### **Turning Budget Control OFF**

- The budget is reset when the feature is disabled.
- Disabling Budget Control resets all stored values.
- Budget metrics will be removed from the preview.
- Re-enabling Budget Control starts fresh tracking with no historical data.

##### **Editing an Existing Budget**

- If you tried to set a new budget lower than the **issued** or **actual spend** amounts, saving is blocked.
- A message indicates: _"Current issued or actual spend cost already exceeds this amount."_

##### **Campaign Overview Enhancements**

A dedicated **Budget card** displays:

- Total Budget
- Issued Cost (liability)
- Actual Spend Cost (redeemed rewards)

Budget tracking continues even when a campaign becomes inactive, as issued rewards may still be redeemed later.

##### **Automated Threshold Notifications**

You will receive email alerts when campaign spending reaches:

- **50%** of budget
- **80%** of budget
- **100%** of budget

At **100%**, the campaign is automatically **deactivated** to prevent additional spending.

### **2. Automatically Trigger Game Popups Based on Page URL**

We introduced a new way to surface Gameball Games on websites by automatically launching a game in a pop-up when a customer visits a specific page. This allows you to deliver game-based engagement experiences without requiring customers to open the Gameball widget. [Learn about campaign URLs](/product-documentation/rewards-campaigns/reward-campaign-url).

#### **What's New**

##### **Automatic Game Popups**

Games such as Spin the Wheel, Slot Machine, and Match Cards can now be triggered automatically when a page URL matches predefined rules. The experience opens directly in a standalone pop-up rather than inside the widget.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/automatic-game-popup.png" alt="Automatic game popup" />
</Frame>

##### **Clean, Focused Game Experience**

- The pop-up shows only the game interface, with no widget navigation or back buttons.
- Customers can play the game or close the pop-up at any time.
- The pop-up closes automatically after the game is completed or dismissed.
- Guest customers can see the game with a lead form, and logged-in customers can access it based on eligibility.

##### **Flexible URL Rule Engine**

You can configure the pop-up to appear:

- On all pages where the widget is installed, or
- Only on pages that match specific URL rules (contains, doesn't contain, is, is not, starts with, ends with), aligned with the existing Web Popups engine.

The pop-up can also be configured to appear:

- Only once per browsing session, or
- A limited number of times per session.

Timing options include:

- Immediately on page load
- After a delay
- After the customer scrolls a defined percentage of the page

##### **Eligibility Controls**

The pop-up will not appear if the customer is no longer eligible for the game (for example, if they reached their daily or total game limit).

When multiple campaigns share the same trigger, the earliest-created one takes priority.

##### **Example Use Cases**

- Launch Spin the Wheel when customers visit pages like /offers or /discounts
- Show the Slot Machine on checkout confirmation pages to encourage account creation
- Trigger Match Cards on the homepage for first-time visitors

### **3. Add Return Window Duration for Tier Entry Reward Points**

**Prevent temporary reward abuse by locking tier-entry points until the return window expires.**

To protect loyalty programs from exploitation, you can now define a **Return Window Duration** for **tier entry reward points**.

This ensures customers cannot instantly redeem tier-upgrade rewards and then refund their qualifying orders to gain unfair benefits.

With this update, tier-entry points can be temporarily **locked (pending)** until the configured window expires, improving reward integrity and reducing fraudulent behavior. [Learn more](/product-documentation/programs/vip-tiers/tier-settings/customizing-benefits-for-different-tiers).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/return-window-duration-tier-points.png" alt="Return window duration for tier entry points" />
</Frame>

#### **What's New**

##### **1. Return Window Duration (Configuration)**

A new field is now available inside each **Tier Entry Reward** setup:

- **Return Window Duration (days)**
- Accepts numeric values ≥ 0
- Default value: **0 days** (points activate immediately)

This gives you full control over how long tier-reward points stay locked before becoming usable.

##### **2. Updated Reward Logic**

When a customer levels up to a new tier:

- Entry reward points are issued with **status = pending**
- Pending duration matches the configured Return Window Duration
- Points automatically switch to **status = active** once the window expires

This ensures points cannot be redeemed during the waiting period.

##### **3. Refund & Downgrade Behavior**

The system now handles return-window scenarios more intelligently:

- **Refund or Tier Downgrade BEFORE activation**
- → Pending points are **revoked automatically**
- **Refund AFTER activation**
- → Standard refund deduction rules apply, as usual.

This eliminates the temporary gain loophole that customers could previously exploit.

## **Other Improvements**

### **1. Lifetime Tier Benefit Coupon Display in the Redeem Tab Overview**

Gameball offers **Lifetime Reward Coupons** for customers who reach specific tiers (e.g., Gold, Platinum). These coupons grant **free benefits** unrelated to points.

However, in the current widget experience, these rewards appear alongside regular point-based rewards and show **0 points**, causing confusion and diminishing the perceived value of tier benefits.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/lifetime-tier-coupon-old-display.png" alt="Old lifetime tier coupon display" />
</Frame>

This update introduces a **new design and placement** for Lifetime Tier Coupons to clearly distinguish them from traditional redemptions.

#### **What's New**

##### **1. Clear Breakup in the Redeem Tab**

- The tier-based lifetime coupon now always appears in a **dedicated top section** of the **Redeem** tab.
- It is visually separated from all point-based rewards to highlight its special nature.

##### **2. New Card Design for Lifetime Tier Benefits**

The updated card:

- Displays the **Tier name** prominently (e.g., "Gold Tier").
- Includes a **"Free Benefit"** label (localized in all supported languages).
- Shows the reward name or, if absent, the correct reward value (all reward types supported).
- Does **not** display any points.
- Uses a clear action button: **"Redeem Now"**.

##### **3. Updated Logic**

**No Points Logic**

- The card **never** shows points.
- The customer will not see "0 points."

##### **Eligibility**

- The lifetime coupon appears **only** if the customer belongs to the tier offering it.

##### **Redemption Flow**

- Selecting **"Redeem Now"** opens the coupon details page (same as the current flow).

### **2. Export Customers from All Automation Action & Control Nodes Overview**

You can now export customers who reach any **Action** or **Control** node inside an automation flow. [Learn how to create an automation campaign](/product-documentation/automation-campaigns/how-to-create-an-automation-campaign).

This enhancement allows teams to run deeper analysis, build external segments, integrate with other tools, or take manual actions outside Gameball.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/export-customers-automation-nodes.png" alt="Export customers from automation nodes" />
</Frame>

##### **1. Export Availability**

- All **Action** and **Control** nodes now include a new option: **Export Customers**.
- Supported node types:
  - **Action nodes:** Send Email, Send Web Message, Grant Reward, and others.
  - **Control nodes:** Wait, Time Delay, Condition, A/B Test.

##### **2. Export Behavior**

- Selecting **Export Customers** initiates a CSV file export of all customers who have **successfully reached** the selected node.
- The export includes **full historical data**, not just recent activity.
- Once prepared, the system sends the CSV file to you via **email**.

### **3. Send `points_redeemed` Event to Integrations**

Gameball now supports sending the `points_redeemed` event to connected integrations, including Insider, MoEngage, and Klaviyo. This update enables you to build real-time journeys, campaigns, and automations in your external marketing platforms based on customer point redemptions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product-docs/product-releases/points-redeemed-event-integration.png" alt="Points redeemed event integration" />
</Frame>

#### **What's New**

##### **1. Automatic Event Delivery**

Whenever a customer redeems points, Gameball automatically fires a `points_redeemed` event to any enabled integration:

- Insider
- MoEngage
- Klaviyo

Events are sent only if the integration is active and the event toggle is enabled for that integration.

##### **2. Event Data Structure**

Each `points_redeemed` The event includes:

- Redeemed points
- Redemption amount
- Redemption transaction ID (if available)

This ensures consistent, reliable data for segmentation and customer journeys across marketing tools.

##### **3. Controls**

- The event is disabled by default for all integrations.
- You can enable or disable the event per integration from the integration's settings page.
- If disabled during integration setup, the system displays a hint instructing you to enable it under Admin Settings.
