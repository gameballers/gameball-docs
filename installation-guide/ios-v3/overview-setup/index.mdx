## Authentication Notes

Starting from SDK v3.1.0, Gameball uses **Session Tokens** to securely authenticate requests between your app and Gameball APIs.

To implement:

1. Retrieve a session token from your backend using the [Create/Update Customer API](https://developer.gameball.co/rest-api/integrations/customers).
2. Pass this token when initializing the SDK.
3. The SDK will automatically handle secure API routing to v4.1 endpoints.

<Note>
  This ensures a secure, tokenized connection between your app and Gameball, preventing direct exposure of your API key.
</Note>
