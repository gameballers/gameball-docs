# Getting Started

## Requirements

- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 13.0+
- **Xcode**: 14.0+
- **Swift**: 5.7+
- **CocoaPods**: 1.11+ or Swift Package Manager

## Install the SDK

You can install the Gameball iOS SDK using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.

### CocoaPods (Recommended)

Add to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Gameball', '~> 3.0.0'
end
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

<Info>
After installation, always open your project using the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file.
</Info>

### Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, select **File → Add Packages...**
2. Enter the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/gameballers/gameball-ios.git
   ```
3. Select version **3.0.0** or **Up to Next Major Version** from 3.0.0
4. Click **Add Package**

## Import the SDK

Import Gameball in your Swift files:

```swift
import Gameball
```

## Verify Installation

Build your project to verify the SDK is properly installed:

```bash
# Using Xcode
⌘ + B

# Using command line
xcodebuild -workspace YourApp.xcworkspace \
           -scheme YourApp \
           -sdk iphonesimulator \
           -configuration Debug build
```

If the build succeeds without errors, you're ready to initialize the SDK!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CocoaPods Installation Fails">
**Error:** `Unable to find a specification for Gameball`

**Solutions:**
- Update CocoaPods repo: `pod repo update`
- Clean CocoaPods cache: `pod cache clean --all`
- Verify your Podfile has the correct syntax
- Ensure your CocoaPods version is 1.11+
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Swift Package Manager Errors">
**Error:** `No such module 'Gameball'`

**Solutions:**
- Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
- Reset package caches: File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
- Verify the package is added to your target's frameworks
- Restart Xcode
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Errors on Older iOS Versions">
**Error:** Deployment target warnings or API availability errors

**Solutions:**
- Ensure minimum deployment target is iOS 13.0+
- Update `Info.plist` if needed
- Check Xcode version is 14.0+
- Verify Swift version is 5.7+
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Framework Not Found">
**Error:** `dyld: Library not loaded` or similar framework errors

**Solutions:**
- For CocoaPods: Run `pod install` again
- For SPM: Remove and re-add the package
- Clean derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- Ensure framework is embedded in your app target
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compile Errors After Update">
**Symptoms:** Build errors after updating the SDK

**Solutions:**
- Clean build folder (⇧⌘K)
- Delete derived data
- Run `pod deintegrate && pod install` for CocoaPods
- Check migration notes for breaking changes
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Debug Logging

The SDK includes built-in logging for development. Logs will appear in Xcode console during debug builds.

To filter SDK logs in Xcode console:

```
# Filter by subsystem
Gameball

# Common log categories
- Initialization
- Network
- Events
- Profile
```

<Tip>
Use Xcode's console filtering to show only Gameball-related logs during development. This helps identify integration issues quickly.
