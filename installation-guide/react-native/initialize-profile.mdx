Show your customer's profile including all details and progress on your React Native app.

## Register Player

To register a player and enable Gameball features, you need to call the `registerPlayer` method. This method requires the player's unique ID and optional attributes.

```javascript
GameballSDK.registerPlayer({
  playerUniqueId: "{CUST_ID}",
  deviceToken: "{deviceToken}",
  referrerCode: "{referrerCode}",
  playerAttributes: {
    displayName: "{displayName}",
    firstName: "{firstName}",
    lastName: "{lastName}",
    email: "{email}",
    mobileNumber: "{mobileNumber}",
    gender: "{gender}",
    dateOfBirth: "{dateOfBirth}",
    joinDate: "{joinDate}",
    preferredLanguage: "{preferredLanguage}",
    customAttributes: {
      // custom key-value pairs
    }
  },
})
```

## Show the Widget

To show the Gameball customer profile that contains the customer details, customer reward campaigns, and the leaderboard use the `showProfile` SDK function.

```javascript
GameballWidget.showProfile({
  playerUniqueId: "{CUST_ID}",
  openDetail: "{openDetail}",
  hideNavigation: false
})
```

<ParamField body="playerUniqueId" type="string" required>
Unique identifier for the customer that you can reference across the customer's whole lifetime. Could be a database ID, random string, email or anything that uniquely identifies the customer.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="openDetail" type="string">
Specify if you want the widget to open on a specific view. See available values
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="hideNavigation" type="boolean">
Set to true to stop widget navigation otherwise leave as null
</ParamField>

<Warning>
**Choose an Unchangeable Player Unique ID**

Gameball user profile gets created using the `playerUniqueId`. It is highly recommended to have the unique ID as an identifier that would NEVER be changed. If this unique ID changes for a given customer, you risk losing all original data for that customer and hence losing their points and rewards on Gameball. Accordingly, it is NOT recommended to use the email address or the mobile number as the unique ID as both can be changed by the user at anytime.
</Warning>
