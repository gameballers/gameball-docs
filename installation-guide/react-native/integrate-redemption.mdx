Enable your customers to redeem their rewarded points.

Through Gameball, you can allow your customers to redeem and use their collected points as discounts while placing new orders on your website. Those points are exchanged for discount coupons or free service/product vouchers during future purchases. Learn more about points redemption.

For e-commerce businesses, points redemption is done with order placement using Order API. A pre-step to that would be checking the customer's balance - using Customer Points Balance API if there are enough points or not for the transaction; and showing the customer his balance.

If you're going to use points redemption in scenarios other than e-commerce, you can use the Redeem API.
