Gameball uses Firebase to deliver maximum experience in your app.

## Configure Gameball With Your Firebase

Before you start, you must configure your Firebase on your Gameball account. Follow the steps in [Configure your Firebase account on Gameball for mobile push notifications](https://help.gameball.co/en/articles/3522353-configure-your-firebase-account-on-gameball-for-mobile-push-notifications) article from our Help Center related to push notifications.

## Handling Push Notifications Integration

For notifications handling, add this code to the **`onNotification`** function in your app:

```javascript
onNotification: (notification) => {
    // you need to check the platform because firebase send the notification based on the platform
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') { // Android
        if (notification.isGB) {
            
        }
    }
    else { // iOS
        if (notification.data.isGB) {
            
        }
    }
}
```
