Integrate your app with Gameball push notifications and interactive in-app messaging.

Gameball uses Firebase to deliver maximum experience in your app.

## Configure Gameball With Your Firebase

Before you start, you must configure your Firebase on your Gameball account. Follow the steps in Configure your Firebase account on Gameball for mobile push notifications article from our Help Center related to push notifications.

## Handling Push Notifications Integration

For notifications handling, add this code to the `onNotification` function in your app:

```javascript
onNotification: (notification) => {
    // you need to check the platform because firebase send the notification based on the platform
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') { // Android
        if (notification.isGB) {
            // Handle Gameball notification for Android
        }
    }
    else { // iOS
        if (notification.data.isGB) {
            // Handle Gameball notification for iOS
        }
    }
}
```
