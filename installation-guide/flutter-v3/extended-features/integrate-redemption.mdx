Enable customers to redeem their earned points for rewards, discounts, or other benefits within your app.

## Redemption Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Customer Balance">
Query the customer's points balance to determine if they have enough points to redeem.
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Redemption">
User requests redemption through your app UI.
</Step>

<Step title="Backend Validation">
Your backend validates the redemption request and calls Gameball server API.
</Step>

<Step title="Update UI">
Backend returns success/failure and the app refreshes the customer profile.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Get Customer Balance

Use the server-side [Customer Points Balance API](/api-reference/customers/progress/get-customer-balance) to check if the customer has enough points for redemption.

## Refresh Profile After Redemption

After a successful redemption on your backend, you can refresh the Gameball profile widget to show updated balances.

## Redemption Implementation

Your backend should:

1. Verify the customer has sufficient points
2. Call [Redeem API](/api-reference/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions/redeem) to create redemption transaction
3. Return the result to your app
4. Update order/cart with the discount if applicable

### App Implementation Example

```dart
Future<void> redeemPoints(int pointsToRedeem) async {
  try {
    // Call your backend endpoint
    final response = await yourBackendAPI.createRedemption(
      customerId: "customer-123",
      points: pointsToRedeem,
    );

    if (response.success) {
      // Show success message
      showSuccessDialog("Points redeemed successfully!");
      
      // Refresh the profile widget to show updated balance
      // You may need to rebuild the widget or navigate back
    } else {
      showErrorDialog(response.message);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    showErrorDialog("Failed to redeem points");
  }
}
```

## E-Commerce Redemption

For e-commerce businesses, points redemption is typically done during checkout using the [Order API](/api-reference/order/order). The redemption details (points to redeem and discount amount) should be handled on your backend.

<Warning>
Always validate redemptions on your backend to prevent fraud and ensure accurate point deductions.
</Warning>

<Info>
For non-e-commerce scenarios, use the [Redeem API](/api-reference/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions/redeem) to create redemption transactions.
