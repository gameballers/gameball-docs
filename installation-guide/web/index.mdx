This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to integrating Gameball's loyalty program with your website or web application. Unlike mobile SDKs, web integration uses REST APIs and an optional JavaScript widget to deliver a seamless loyalty experience to your online customers.

<Info>
Gameball's web integration is designed for websites and web applications. It combines REST API calls for server-side operations with an optional JavaScript widget for customer-facing features.
