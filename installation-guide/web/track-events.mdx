title: "Track Customer Events"
description: "Start sending your customer's events on your platform to Gameball"
---

Send your customer's **events** on your platform to Gameball, along with any **metadata** that describes the event. Depending on your Gameball programs configuration, the customers can be rewarded based on the sent events.

Customer **events** can be sent to Gameball via the [Track Events API](/api-reference/events/send-events).

## What are Events?

Every `Track Event` call records a single user action. We call these "**events**". We recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone can know what they mean instantly.

**Event metadata** are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while designing your program.

<Info>
Tracked **events** can be UI events or server side events depending on how you would like to design your programs.
</Info>

## Event Tracking Benefits

Tracking events allows you to:

1. **Gain insights** into what your customers are doing on your platform
2. **Reward actions** in real-time to drive more engagement
3. **Personalize experiences** based on customer interests and behaviors

## Example: E-commerce Event Tracking

Let's say you run an online store and want to reward customers when they add items to their carts.

### Basic Add to Cart Event

When a customer clicks "Add to Cart", you can send a simple event to Gameball:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/v4.0/events' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'TransactionKey: YOUR_TRANSACTION_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "events": {
      "add_to_cart": {}
    },
    "customerId": "CUST_ID"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

### Enhanced Add to Cart Event

If you want to go further, add details like product ID, price, and category:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/v4.0/events' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'TransactionKey: YOUR_TRANSACTION_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "events": {
      "add_to_cart": {
        "product_id": "231402",
        "product_title": "iPhone 12",
        "price": 1350.00,
        "category": "Electronics",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    },
    "customerId": "CUST_ID"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Event Metadata Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Use Descriptive Names">
  Make event names human-readable and descriptive:
  
  ✅ Good: `product_viewed`, `checkout_started`, `review_submitted`
  
  ❌ Bad: `evt1`, `action_a`, `click_btn`
</Step>

<Step title="Include Relevant Metadata">
  Add useful information that can be used for targeting and analytics:
  
  ```json
  {
    "events": {
      "product_viewed": {
        "product_id": "12345",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 299.99,
        "brand": "Apple"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Be Consistent">
  Use consistent naming conventions and data structures across your events
</Step>
</Steps>
