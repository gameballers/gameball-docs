# Migration Notes

## Overview

This document provides guidance for migrating or updating your POS integration with Gameball.

## API Version Updates

### Current Version: v4.0

The POS integration guide uses Gameball API v4.0. If you're migrating from an older version, review the API changelog for breaking changes.

## Common Migration Scenarios

### Updating API Endpoints

If you need to update your API endpoints:

1. Review the current API version in use
2. Update base URLs to match the new version
3. Test all API calls with the new endpoints
4. Update error handling for new response formats

### Changing Customer Identification

If you need to change how customers are identified:

1. Ensure `customerId` values remain consistent
2. Update customer lookup logic if switching between mobile/email
3. Test customer identification across all flows
4. Verify existing customer data is accessible

### Adding New Features

When adding new features like QR code support:

1. Review the feature documentation
2. Update POS UI to support new workflows
3. Test the new feature in isolation
4. Integrate with existing flows
5. Update staff training materials

## Best Practices

- Test migrations in a staging environment first
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any custom implementations
- Keep API credentials secure during migration
- Monitor error rates after migration

<Warning>
Always test migration changes thoroughly before deploying to production.
