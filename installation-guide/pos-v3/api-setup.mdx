## API Authentication

To integrate Gameball with your POS system, you'll need to authenticate all API requests using your Gameball API credentials.

### Required Credentials

- **API Key**: Your Gameball API key
- **API Secret**: Your Gameball API secret

These credentials are provided when you create your Gameball account and can be found in your Gameball dashboard under Settings > API Credentials.

### Authentication Method

All API requests must include authentication headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Or use API key authentication:

```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET
```

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.gameball.co
```

### API Version

This integration guide uses Gameball API v4.0. Ensure your API calls target the correct version endpoint:

```
https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Always use HTTPS for all API calls. Never send API credentials over unencrypted connections.
</Warning>

- Store API credentials securely in your POS system configuration
- Never expose API keys in client-side code or logs
- Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security
- Use hash validation for QR code-based redemptions

## Next Steps
