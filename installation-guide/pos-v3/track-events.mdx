## Overview

Event tracking allows you to capture customer actions and behaviors at your POS system, enabling Gameball to trigger campaigns, rewards, and personalized experiences based on customer activity.

## When to Use Event Tracking

While order tracking (via the Track Order API) automatically captures purchase events, you may want to track additional customer actions such as:

- Customer visits to the store
- Product category preferences
- Special promotions or campaigns
- Non-purchase activities

## Implementation

Use the Send Events API to track customer actions:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/events' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "mobile_966500001234",
    "eventName": "store_visit",
    "metadata": {
      "store_location": "Mall Branch A",
      "visit_date": "2025-09-29T15:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event tracked successfully"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Key Considerations

- Events can trigger automated campaigns configured in your Gameball dashboard
- Use descriptive event names that align with your business logic
- Include relevant metadata to enable advanced targeting and segmentation
- Events are processed asynchronously and may not reflect immediately in customer profiles

<Note>
For most POS integrations, order tracking is sufficient. Event tracking is optional and typically used for advanced use cases or specific campaign requirements.
