## Requirements

- **POS System**: Must support API integration (REST API calls)
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for API calls
- **Authentication**: Gameball API key and secret
- **QR Scanner** (Optional): For QR code-based customer verification

## Key Differences from Mobile SDKs

Unlike mobile SDKs, POS integration:

- Uses **REST APIs** instead of native SDKs
- Requires **server-side API calls** from your POS backend
- Focuses on **checkout workflows** rather than app experiences
- Supports **QR code verification** for customer identification
- Enables **real-time point redemption** during checkout
