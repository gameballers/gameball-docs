## Use Case: Retrieving an Existing Customer's Loyalty Balance

### What This Is

This use case explains how to retrieve a returning customer's current loyalty balance from Gameball using their unique identifier (e.g., mobile number or email) during checkout.

This enables your store staff to show customers their current point balance, validate redemption eligibility, or simply reinforce the value of participating in the loyalty program.

### Why It Matters

- Increases visibility of rewards and boosts engagement
- Enables point redemption eligibility checks at the point of sale
- Encourages loyalty usage by creating a "use it before you lose it" prompt
- Failing to retrieve a customer's balance at the right moment often results in missed redemptions, lower perceived value, and a disjointed experience

### How to Implement It

Call the Get Customer Balance API as soon as the customer is identified in the POS system.

Required input:

- `customerId` (the unique ID used in their Gameball profile)

The API returns all relevant data needed to display available and pending balances, monetary value, and expiring points.

### Example Scenario

The customer returns to the store and provides their phone number. The cashier enters the number into the POS, which triggers the following call:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/customers/mobile_966500001234/balance' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "totalPointsBalance": 1500,
  "availablePointsBalance": 1200,
  "availablePointsValue": 120.0,
  "pendingPoints": 300,
  "pendingPointsValue": 30.0,
  "currency": "SAR",
  "pointsName": "Reward Points",
  "nextExpiringPointsAmount": 200,
  "nextExpiringPointsValue": 20.0,
  "nextExpiringPointsDate": "2024-12-01T00:00:00"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### What Gameball Does Behind the Scenes

- Retrieves the most up-to-date view of the customer's reward profile
- Calculates point values and any pending or expiring balances
- Returns metadata that can be shown in-store to prompt redemption or urgency

### Clerk Prompt (Optional)

"You currently have 1,200 reward points, worth 120 SAR. Would you like to use them today? Keep in mind, 200 points will expire soon."

### Key Takeaways for Developers

- Always retrieve the customer's balance before enabling redemption or prompting for point usage
- Display both the numeric point balance and its monetary equivalent (`availablePointsValue`)
- Use `nextExpiringPointsDate` and `nextExpiringPointsValue` to inform customer-facing prompts
- Consider caching logic only if you're controlling refresh timing; otherwise, rely on real-time API calls
