# Initialize Customer Profile

## Use Case: Registering a New Customer During Checkout

### What This Is

This use case outlines how to register a new customer in Gameball's loyalty program through the POS, enabling them to earn and redeem points on future visits.

When a first-time shopper checks out, the store clerk collects basic information—such as mobile number or email—used to create a new Gameball profile in the background via API.

### Why It Matters

A Gameball profile is the foundation for any loyalty engagement.

- Without registration, purchases cannot be tracked, and no rewards can be issued
- Early registration allows for welcome bonuses, tier progress, and behavioral targeting
- Failure to register customers is the #1 reason for low program engagement in offline channels

### How to Implement It

Call the Create/Update Customer API from your POS system upon checkout.

At minimum, provide:

- A unique `customerId` (your internal identifier, phone number, or email)
- One of: `email` or `mobile`

This API is idempotent. If the customer already exists, the profile will be updated instead of duplicated.

### Example Scenario

At checkout, the store clerk asks the shopper for their mobile number. The POS system sends the following background request to register them into Gameball:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/customers' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "mobile_966500001234",
    "name": "Loyal Shopper",
    "email": "shopper@example.com",
    "mobile": "+966500001234"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "customerId": "mobile_966500001234",
  "name": "Loyal Shopper",
  "email": "shopper@example.com",
  "mobile": "+966500001234",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-29T15:00:00Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### What Gameball Does Behind the Scenes

- Creates a new customer profile in the loyalty database
- Triggers any configured onboarding campaigns (e.g., welcome bonus)
- Prepares the profile for earning, tiering, and redemption

### Key Takeaways for Developers

- Use a persistent and unique `customerId` across all platforms (POS, online, app)
- Call this API immediately before checkout or as soon as the identifier is collected
- Ensure your POS UI clearly captures at least one contact field (mobile/email)
- You can use this API proactively—even for existing customers—without conflict
