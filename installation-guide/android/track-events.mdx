title: "Track Customer Events"
description: "Send customer events from your Android app to Gameball"
---

Start sending your customers' **events** on your app to Gameball, along with any **metadata** that describes the event. Depending on your Gameball programs configuration, the customer can be rewarded based upon the sent events.

Tracked **events** can be app events or server-side events depending on how you would like to design your programs. App **events** can be sent via the available SDK interface and server-side **events** can be sent to Gameball via the [Track Events API](/api-reference/events/send-events).

Every `Track Event` call records a single customer action which we call "**events**". We recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone can figure them out instantly.

**Event metadata** are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while designing your program.

To send Customer events from your app to Gameball, you can use the **`sendEvent`** method as shown below.

## Parameters

<ParamField body="event" type="object" required>
Event body that is being sent to Gameball.

<Expandable title="Event Object">

<ParamField body="withCustomerId" type="string" required>
The customer's unique identifier.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="withEventName" type="string" required>
String representing the event name (e.g., `write_review`, `place_order`, etc.), where each key is the event name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="withEventMetadata" type="object">
An object containing metadata related to the event. The structure of the event object can vary depending on the specific event being recorded. Events can be any significant action a customer performs, such as making a purchase, writing a review, adding to cart, etc.
</ParamField>

</Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="callback" type="function">
Callback is used for providing the developer with the status of the request as a boolean whether it succeeded or not or with an error if any.

## Create Event Object

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
Event event = new Event.Builder()
        .withCustomerId("customer123")
        .withEventName("purchase_completed")
        .withEmail("jack@domain.com")
        .withMobile("0123456789")
        .withEventMetaData("purchase_price", 19.99)
        .build();
```

```kotlin Kotlin
val event = Event.Builder()
    .withCustomerId("customer123")
    .withEventName("purchase_completed")
    .withEmail("jack@domain.com")
    .withMobile("0123456789")
    .withEventMetaData("purchase_price", 19.99)
    .build()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Send the Event

Using the previously created GameballApp instance or by creating a new one, call the ***sendEvent()*** method as shown below.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
gameballApp.sendEvent(event, new Callback<Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(Boolean aBoolean) {
        // TODO Handle on success result
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        // TODO Handle on failure result
    }
});
```

```kotlin Kotlin
gameballApp.sendEvent(event, object : Callback<Boolean?> {
    override fun onSuccess(aBoolean: Boolean?) {
        // TODO Handle on success result
    }

    override fun onError(e: Throwable) {
        // TODO Handle on failure result
    }
})
```
</CodeGroup>
