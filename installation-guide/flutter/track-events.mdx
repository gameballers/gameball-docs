Start sending your customers' events from your Flutter app to Gameball. By tracking actions such as purchases, sign-ups, and other key interactions, you can tailor rewards and communications to engage your customers more effectively.

<Info>
For detailed event tracking implementation, please refer to the [Tracking Customer Events tutorial](/tutorials/track-customer-events) and [Events API Reference](/api-reference/events/send-events).

## Event Tracking Implementation

To track customer events in your Flutter app, you need to create an Event object and send it using the sendEvent method.

### Create Event Object

First, create an Event object with the customer ID and event data:

```dart
Event eventBody = Event(
  customerId: "customer_id",
  events: {
    "event_name": {
      "property1": "value1",
      "property2": "value2"
    }
  }
);
```

### Send the Event

Using the previously created GameballApp instance or by creating a new one, call the **sendEvent()** method as shown below:

```dart
// SendEventCallback
sendEventCallback(response, error){
  if(error == null && response != null){
    // TODO Handle on success result.
  }
  else{
    // TODO Handle on failure result.
  }
}
    
gameballApp.sendEvent(eventBody, sendEventCallback);
```

## Event Types

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consistent Event Naming">
    Use consistent naming conventions for your events across all platforms (Web, iOS, Android, Flutter)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Relevant Properties">
    Add relevant properties to events to provide context and enable better analytics
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Errors Gracefully">
    Implement proper error handling in your event callback functions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Event Tracking">
    Test event tracking in development before deploying to production
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Event Properties

When creating events, you can include various properties to provide context:

```dart
Event eventBody = Event(
  customerId: "customer_123",
  events: {
    "purchase": {
      "orderId": "ORD-12345",
      "amount": 99.99,
      "currency": "USD",

        {
          "productId": "PROD-001",
          "name": "Sample Product",
          "price": 99.99,
          "quantity": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
);
```
