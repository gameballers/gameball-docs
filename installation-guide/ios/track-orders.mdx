Start tracking customer's orders on your platform upon order completion and successful payment. This enables rewarding the customer with cashback wallet points for paid amounts as per your cashback program configuration on Gameball.

Cashback rewarding and order tracking can be done via server side [Order API](/api-reference/order/order-tracking) which is a tailored API to support **e-commerce** platforms.

In case you want to reward your customer with cashback wallet points for scenarios other than e-commerce order placement, you can use [Cashback API](/api-reference/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions/cashback) based on your use case.
