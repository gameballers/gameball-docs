# Track Orders & Cashback Reward

Track orders and enable cashback rewards for your customers. Order tracking is typically done via server-side [Order API](/api-reference/order/order-tracking) for better security and control.

Cashback rewarding and order tracking can be done via server side [Order API](/api-reference/order/order-tracking) which is a tailored API to support **e-commerce** platforms.

In case you want to reward your customer with cashback wallet points for scenarios other than e-commerce order placement, you can use [Cashback API](/api-reference/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions/cashback) based on your use case.

<Warning>
**Best Practice**: Send orders only after they're confirmed/paid to avoid incorrect reward assignment. For COD orders, wait until payment is captured.
</Warning>

<Info>
For more advanced order tracking scenarios, use the server-side [Order API](/api-reference/order/order-tracking) for better control and security.
