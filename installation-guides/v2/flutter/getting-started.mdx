The Gameball SDK for Flutter enables you to use the show Gameball customer profile in your app, track app customer events, and integrate referrals.

## Installation

Follow the below steps to start installing Flutter SDK package to your app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK package">
    Install package using flutter:
    
    ```bash
    $ flutter pub add gameball_sdk
    ```
    
    This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit `flutter pub get`):
    
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      gameball_sdk: ^2.2.0
    ```
    
    Alternatively, your editor might support `flutter pub get`. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Internet Permission">
    Make sure that you added the INTERNET permission in your application's **AndroidManifest.xml** and **info.plist** files
  </Step>
</Steps>

### To install Firebase Google Play Services dependencies

Firebase is an integral dependency to the sdk, you'll have to include the following dependencies in your project's **pubspec.yaml** file

```bash
$ flutter pub add firebase_core
$ flutter pub add firebase_dynamic_links
$ flutter pub add firebase_messaging
```

Then run the `flutter pub get` command.

<Info>
It is also required to have a Firebase project configured and linked to your project, follow this tutorial on how to integrate with Firebase.
