## Overview

Referral tracking allows you to reward customers for bringing new customers to your store. When a new customer makes their first purchase and mentions a referrer, you can track this relationship and reward both parties.

## Implementation

Referral tracking is typically handled through the order submission process. When a new customer makes their first purchase, include the referrer's customer ID in the order payload.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/orders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'SecretKey: YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "mobile_966500001234",
    "orderId": "POS_987654323",
    "orderDate": "2025-09-29T15:20:00Z",
    "totalPaid": 250,
    "totalPrice": 250,
    "referrerCode": "REF123456"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Referral Flow

1. **New Customer Registration**: Register the new customer using the Initialize Customer Profile API
2. **Referrer Identification**: Collect the referrer's code or customer ID at checkout
3. **Order Submission**: Include the referrer information in the order payload
4. **Reward Issuance**: Gameball automatically processes referral rewards based on your configured campaign rules

## Key Considerations

- Referral codes can be collected manually by store staff or scanned from QR codes
- Referral rewards are configured in your Gameball dashboard
- Both the referrer and the new customer may receive rewards based on your campaign settings
- Referral tracking must occur during the new customer's first purchase

<Note>
Referral tracking is optional and depends on your business requirements. If you don't have a referral program, you can skip this feature.
