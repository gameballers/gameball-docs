</Info>

## Integration Overview

By integrating Gameball directly into your existing POS workflow, you eliminate the need for third-party apps or additional overhead while giving customers a visible, valuable reason to come back.

This integration guide will walk you through a modular, use-case-driven approach to integrating Gameball's loyalty logic into your POS operations—complete with business context, implementation flows, example payloads, and backend reactions.

## What You Can Do

Integrating Gameball's loyalty program with your POS system allows you to:

- **Register new customers** or identify existing ones during checkout
- **Retrieve customer balance** to display loyalty information
- **Reward purchases** with points and campaigns in real time
- **Redeem points** for discounts or gifts—seamlessly, securely, and quickly
- **Track customer events** for additional engagement opportunities
- **Verify identity** via secure QR codes or virtual passes (optional)

## Typical Workflow

The standard POS integration workflow follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Lookup Customer">
    GET `/integrations/customers/{customerId}/balance` - Check if customer exists and retrieve balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Create Customer (if needed)">
    POST `/integrations/customers` - Create new customer profile if not found
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Display Balance">
    Show available points, monetary value, and expiring points to the customer
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Offer Redemption">
    POST `/integrations/transactions/hold` - Hold points if customer wants to redeem
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Place Order">
    POST `/integrations/orders` - Submit order with hold reference to finalize redemption
  </Step>
  <Step title="6. Show Earned Points">
    Display `rewardedPoints` from order response to show points earned
  </Step>
  <Step title="7. Handle Refunds (if needed)">
    POST `/integrations/transactions/refund` - Reverse order and restore points
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requirements

- **POS System**: Must support API integration (REST API calls)
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for API calls
- **Authentication**: Gameball API key and secret
- **QR Scanner** (Optional): For QR code-based customer verification

## Key Differences from Mobile SDKs

Unlike mobile SDKs, POS integration:

- Uses **REST APIs** instead of native SDKs
- Requires **server-side API calls** from your POS backend
- Focuses on **checkout workflows** rather than app experiences
- Supports **QR code verification** for customer identification
- Enables **real-time point redemption** during checkout
