## Refund / Cancel an Order

When a customer returns items or cancels an order, use the Refund API to reverse the transaction and restore points to the customer's balance.

### What This Is

This use case explains how to process refunds or cancellations for completed orders, ensuring that:
- Points redeemed during the original order are restored
- Points earned from the original order are deducted
- The customer's balance is accurately updated

### Why It Matters

- Maintains accurate customer point balances
- Prevents point manipulation or fraud
- Ensures fair treatment of customers during returns
- Required for proper financial reconciliation

### How to Implement It

Use the Refund Transaction API to reverse a completed order:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/transactions/refund' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'SecretKey: YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "12345",
    "refundTransactionId": "REFUND0001",
    "reverseTransactionId": "ORD000123",
    "transactionTime": "2025-10-19T12:30:00Z",
    "refundAmount": 100.00
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "gameballTransactionId": "11034735",
  "refundTransactionId": "REFUND0001",
  "refundAmount": 100.00,
  "refundEquivalentPoints": 100
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<Note>
The response schema follows the API v4 format. The `gameballTransactionId` is the unique identifier for the refund transaction in the Gameball system, and `refundEquivalentPoints` represents the number of points equivalent to the monetary value refunded.
</Note>

### Required Fields

- **customerId**: The unique identifier for the customer
- **refundTransactionId**: A unique identifier for this refund transaction
- **reverseTransactionId**: The original order ID that is being refunded
- **transactionTime**: The timestamp when the refund occurred
- **refundAmount**: The amount being refunded to the customer

### What Gameball Does Behind the Scenes

- Reverses the original order transaction
- Restores any points that were redeemed during the original order
- Deducts any points that were earned from the original order
- Updates the customer's balance accordingly
- Records the refund in the transaction history

### Key Takeaways for Developers

- Always use a unique `refundTransactionId` for each refund
- The `reverseTransactionId` must match an existing order ID
- Refunds should be processed as soon as the return is confirmed
- Partial refunds are supported—adjust the `refundAmount` accordingly
- The refund amount should match the original order's `totalPaid` value for full refunds
