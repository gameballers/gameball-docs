title: "How Do I Track Customer Events?"
description: "Send customer events from your React Native app to Gameball"
---

Start sending your customer's **events** on your app or platform to Gameball, along with any **metadata** that describes the event. Depending on your Gameball programs configuration, the customer can be rewarded based on the sent events.

Every `Track Event` call records a single customer action. We call these "**events**". We recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone can know what they mean instantly.

**Event metadata** are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while designing your program.

Tracked **events** can be app events or server-side events depending on how you would like to design your programs. App events can be sent to Gameball via the methods available in the SDK below. For server-side events you can use [Track Events API](/api-reference/events/send-events).

</Tip>

To send Customer events from your app to Gameball, you can use the **`sendEvent`** SDK interface as below.

Import **Gameball SDK**

```typescript
import {GameballSdk} from 'react-native-gameball';
```

Sending event without metadata in the form `{String: any}`

```typescript
GameballSdk.sendEvent({"review": {}})
    .then(response => console.log(response)) // on success
    .catch(error => console.log(error)) // on error
```

Sending event with different metadata in the form `{String: {String: any}}`

```typescript
GameballSdk.sendEvent({
  "place_order": {
    "amount": "100",
    "type": "Electronics"
  }
})
  .then(response => console.log(response)) // on success
  .catch(error => console.log(error)) // on error
```
