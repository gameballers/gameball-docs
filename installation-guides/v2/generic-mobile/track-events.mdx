Start sending your customers' events on your platform to Gameball.

Start sending your customer's **events** on your platform to Gameball, along with any **metadata** that describes the event. Depending on your Gameball programs configuration, the customers can be rewarded based on the sent events.

Customer **events** can be sent to Gameball via the Track Events API.

Every `Track Event` call records a single user action. We call these "**events**". We recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone can know what they mean instantly.

**Event metadata** are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while designing your program.

Tracked **events** can be UI events or server side events depending on how you would like to design your programs.
