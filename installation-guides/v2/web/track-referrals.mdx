## Overview

Referral tracking allows you to reward customers for bringing new customers to your platform. When a new customer signs up or makes their first purchase using a referral code, both the referrer and the new customer can receive rewards based on your configured campaign rules.

## How Referrals Work

1. **Existing customer** shares their referral code or link
2. **New customer** signs up or makes a purchase using the referral code
3. **Gameball processes** the referral and awards rewards to both parties
4. **Rewards are configured** in your Gameball dashboard

## Implementation Methods

### Method 1: Include Referral Code During Customer Creation

When creating a new customer profile, include the referrer's code:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/customers' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'TransactionKey: YOUR_TRANSACTION_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "new_user_123",
    "customerAttributes": {
      "displayName": "New Customer",
      "email": "newcustomer@example.com"
    },
    "referrerCode": "REF123456"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

### Method 2: Include Referral Code in First Order

Alternatively, include the referral code when tracking the new customer's first order:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/orders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'TransactionKey: YOUR_TRANSACTION_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "new_user_123",
    "orderId": "ORD_987654",
    "orderDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "totalPaid": 100.00,
    "totalPrice": 100.00,
    "referrerCode": "REF123456"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Getting Customer Referral Code

To display a customer's referral code in your widget or custom UI, retrieve it from the customer profile:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/customers/user_12345' \
  -H 'APIKey: YOUR_API_KEY'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "customerId": "user_12345",
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "referralCode": "REF123456",
  "referralLink": "https://yourwebsite.com/signup?ref=REF123456"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Referral Link Generation

You can generate referral links using the customer's referral code:

```
https://yourwebsite.com/signup?ref={referralCode}
```

Or use Gameball's referral link format if you've configured it in your dashboard.

## Widget Integration

If you're using the Gameball widget, referral codes and links are automatically displayed to customers in their profile view. No additional integration is required.

## Key Considerations

- **Referral tracking must occur** during the new customer's first interaction (signup or first purchase)
- **Referral rewards are configured** in your Gameball dashboard under Campaigns
- **Both referrer and new customer** may receive rewards based on your campaign settings
- **Referral codes are unique** per customer and don't expire unless configured otherwise

<Note>
Referral tracking is optional. If you don't have a referral program configured, you can skip this feature.
