title: "What Is Go-Live Checklist?"
description: "Verify your Gameball iOS SDK integration before releasing to production"
---

Use this checklist to ensure your **Gameball iOS SDK v3.1.1** integration is functionally correct, secure, and ready for production launch.

<Info>
  Use your **Test API Key** during development. Only switch to your **Live API Key** after completing all checklist items and validating the integration.
</Info>

# 1. SDK Installation & Environment Setup

- Gameball iOS SDK **v3.1.1** installed via Swift Package Manager
- Project builds cleanly with **no warnings or dependency conflicts**
- `import Gameball` works across the project
- `GameballApp.getInstance().init(config:)` is called at startup (AppDelegate or App struct)
- Minimum iOS version set to **12.0+**
- Swift version is **5.0+**
- Test and Production keys stored securely (not committed to VCS)

<Tip>
  See: [**Getting Started**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/getting-started)
</Tip>

# 2. Customer Initialization & Profile Registration

- SDK initialization succeeds with Test API Key
- `initializeCustomer` creates/updates customer profiles correctly
- Custom attributes mapped properly and visible in dashboard
- Device token registered with Gameball (if push notifications enabled)
- Referral code passed correctly for newly referred customers
- Guest user flow tested (if applicable)
- Errors handled gracefully (network issues, invalid input, auth errors)

<Tip>
  See: [**Initialize Customer Profile**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/initialize-profile)
</Tip>

---

# 3. Event Tracking Validation

- All required customer actions mapped to events
- Events successfully sent using `sendEvent`
- Events appear in Gameball dashboard with correct metadata
- Event-based rewards trigger successfully
- Async/Await and callback variants tested
- Metadata keys follow consistent naming conventions
- Error handling implemented for timeouts, auth errors, and invalid payloads

<Tip>
  See: [**Track Customer Events**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/track-events)
</Tip>

---

# 4. Profile Widget Validation

- Widget opens correctly inside the app (UIKit & SwiftUI)
- Customer data (points, referrals, tiers, rewards) loads correctly
- Navigation within widget works without crashes
- Close button behavior correct (if enabled)
- Deep linking with `openDetail` behaves as expected
- Widget theme reflects dashboard customization

<Tip>
  See: [**Show Profile Widget**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/show-profile)
</Tip>

---

# 5. Push Notifications (Firebase / Huawei)

- Push Notifications capability enabled in Xcode
- Permission request shown at a meaningful moment (not app launch)
- Device token registered successfully via `initializeCustomer`
- Firebase or Huawei push service configured in your project
- Test notifications received on physical devices from Gameball
- Foreground/background notification handling implemented
- Deep link navigation implemented for Gameball notification actions
- Device token refresh handled

<Tip>
  See: [**Push Notifications**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/push-notifications)
</Tip>

---

# 6. Referrals (Branch or Adjust)

- Selected provider integrated (Branch or Adjust)
- Universal Links configured and verified
- Deep linking + deferred deep linking both tested
- Referral code extracted correctly from provider payload
- Referral code passed to Gameball during registration
- Referral link sharing UI tested
- Referral rewards trigger successfully for referrer & referee
- Firebase Dynamic Links fully removed (deprecated)

<Tip>
  See: [**Track Referrals**](/installation-guides/v3/ios/track-referrals)
</Tip>

---

# 7. Security, Authentication & Session Tokens

- Session Token implemented if backend-auth is required
- API version routing (v4.0 / v4.1) verified if using Session Token
- Secret keys not included in client-side code
- HTTPS enforced, no insecure communication
- App logs do not expose sensitive data

---

# 8. Multi-Environment & Build Verification

- Tested in Debug, Stage, and Production environments
- Gameball Test → Production API key switch validated
- Release build tested on physical devices
- Feature flags and environment switches validated

---

# 9. Performance & Stability

- No memory leaks in widget or SDK APIs
- No crashes in repeated widget open/close cycles
- API calls retry gracefully on poor networks
- Offline mode behavior (retry, error messages) reviewed
- Long session stability verified

---

# 10. Dashboard & Backend Alignment

- All earning rules and rewards set up correctly
- Redemption settings & limits configured
- Referral rules finalized
- Push provider configuration verified in Gameball dashboard
- Test user transactions visible in Gameball dashboard
- Segments, tiers, and campaigns behave as expected

---

# 11. Pre-Launch QA & Monitoring Setup

- Full customer lifecycle tested (signup → earn → redeem → notify → track)
- Regression testing performed on all integration points
- Analytics and monitoring tools enabled (e.g., Crashlytics, Sentry)
- Support team prepared for launch
- Documentation shared with engineering & product teams

<Check>
  If every item above is complete, your Gameball iOS SDK integration is fully production-ready.
</Check>
