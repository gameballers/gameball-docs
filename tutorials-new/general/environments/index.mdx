title: 'Test and Live Environments'
description: 'Separate environments for safe development and production deployment'
---

Gameball provides **separate test and live environments** to enable safe development and testing before deploying to production. Both environments share the same configurations but maintain completely isolated data.

---

## API Keys

You have access to three keys in your Gameball Dashboard (**Settings → Admin Settings → Account Integration**):

| Key | Purpose | Usage |
|-----|---------|-------|
| **Test API Key** | Development & staging | Use in UAT/staging environments during integration |
| **Live API Key** | Production | Use in production once you go live |
| **Secret Key** | Point transactions & high security | Required for sensitive operations (same key works for both test/live) |

<Note>
**Same Base URL**: Both test and live use `https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0` — you only change the API key.
</Note>

---

## What's Shared vs Separated

### Shared (Mirrored Configurations)
These apply to both test and live:
- Tiers and VIP levels
- Campaign rules and logic
- Widget configuration
- Point earning/redemption rules
- Experience design

### Separated (Isolated Data)
Test and live maintain separate:
- **Customers list**: Test customers don't appear in live
- **Analytics**: Separate reporting for test vs live
- **Point transactions**: Test points isolated from live points
- **Achievements**: Customer progress tracked separately

<Tip>
Configure your campaigns and tiers once—they automatically work in both environments. Only the customer data differs.
</Tip>

---

## Dashboard Toggle

Switch between test and live views in the Gameball Dashboard:

1. Look for the toggle at the **top left** of any dashboard page
2. Select **Test** to view test data or **Live** to view production data
3. Analytics, customer lists, and transactions update based on your selection

This lets you inspect test behavior before deploying to production.

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure in Dashboard">
  Set up tiers, campaigns, point logic, and widget behavior. These configurations apply to both test and live.
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate with Test Key">
  Use the **Test API Key** in your staging/UAT environment. Build your integration and test thoroughly.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Test Data">
  Switch dashboard to **Test mode** and verify:
  - Customer registration works
  - Points accrue correctly
  - Campaigns trigger as expected
  - Redemption flows function properly
</Step>

<Step title="QA & Edge Cases">
  Test edge cases, error handling, concurrent operations, and campaign expirations using test environment.
</Step>

<Step title="Switch to Live Key">
  Replace **Test API Key** with **Live API Key** in your production application. Live customers and data will now be tracked.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Live Environment">
  Switch dashboard to **Live mode** and monitor real customers, transactions, and analytics.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Points

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Isolation" icon="shield-check">
    Test and live data never mix. Test customers, points, and transactions are completely separate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Migration" icon="ban">
    Test data is disposable. You cannot migrate test customers or transactions to live.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fresh Start" icon="sparkles">
    When you go live, start with a clean slate. All live data begins from scratch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key Rotation" icon="rotate">
    Gameball supports key rotation without disrupting existing integrations.

## Example: Switching Environments

### Test Environment (Staging)
```javascript
// staging.config.js
const GAMEBALL_API_KEY = "test_ue7eh32eiwlsncoko08u8b";
const GAMEBALL_SECRET_KEY = "kz7eh32eiwldlowbo08u5p";
```

### Live Environment (Production)
```javascript
// production.config.js
const GAMEBALL_API_KEY = "live_8x4mh92kwjancblp07r9d";
const GAMEBALL_SECRET_KEY = "kz7eh32eiwldlowbo08u5p"; // Same secret key
```

<Warning>
**Never expose your Live API Key or Secret Key** in client-side code or public repositories. Keep them secure in environment variables or server-side configuration.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="key">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not hardcoded:
    ```bash
    # .env.staging
    GAMEBALL_API_KEY=test_ue7eh32eiwlsncoko08u8b
    
    # .env.production
    GAMEBALL_API_KEY=live_8x4mh92kwjancblp07r9d
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Thoroughly Before Live" icon="vial">
    - Test all integration points with test key
    - Verify campaign triggers and point calculations
    - Test redemption flows and edge cases
    - Validate error handling and retry logic
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Treat Test Data as Disposable" icon="trash">
    - Don't worry about cleaning up test customers or transactions
    - Test data has no impact on live environment
    - Start fresh when switching to live
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Both Environments" icon="chart-line">
    - Use dashboard toggle to check test behavior during development
    - Monitor live analytics once in production
    - Compare test vs live to validate expected behavior
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## High Security Mode

Enable **High Security Mode** in dashboard to require **Secret Key** for all API requests (not just point transactions).

When enabled:
- All endpoints require both `APIKey` and `SecretKey` headers
- Provides additional protection against unauthorized access
- Recommended for high-security requirements

<Warning>
With High Security Mode enabled, send all requests from **server-side** to prevent exposing the Secret Key.
</Warning>
