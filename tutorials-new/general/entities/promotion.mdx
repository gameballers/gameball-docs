# Promotions

**Promotions** (automatic coupons) are discounts that apply automatically based on cart contents, order value, or customer eligibility—without requiring customers to enter a code.

## Promotion Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `percentage` | Percentage discount | 20% off |
| `fixed` | Fixed amount off | $50 off |
| `shipping` | Free shipping | Waive shipping |
| `product` | Discount specific products | 30% off sale items |
| `buyXgetY` | Bundle deals | Buy 2, Get 1 Free |
