title: 'What Are Attributes?'
description: 'Customer profile data that powers personalization and segmentation'
---

**Attributes** are data points stored about each customer—their name, email, purchase history, and custom business-specific information. These enable personalized campaigns, targeted messaging, and customer segmentation.

### Purchase History Attributes
Automatically tracked when using the Orders API:

| `totalSpent` | Number | Lifetime spending total |
| `totalOrders` | Integer | Number of orders placed |
| `avgOrderAmount` | Number | Average order value |
| `lastOrderDate` | String | Date of most recent purchase |

### Custom Attributes
Flexible key-value pairs for business-specific data:

```json
{
  "customerId": "customer_123",
  "customerAttributes": {
    "displayName": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "custom": {
      "vip_status": "Gold",
      "subscription_tier": "Premium",
      "favorite_category": "Electronics"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
**Reserved Properties**: The Standard Attributes and Purchase History Attributes listed above are **reserved** and cannot be sent within the `custom` object. Only send standard attributes at the root level of `customerAttributes`, and use the `custom` object exclusively for your business-specific data fields.
</Warning>

## Setting Attributes

```json
POST /api/v4.0/integrations/customers
{
  "customerId": "customer_123",
  "customerAttributes": {
    "displayName": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "city": "New York",
    "custom": {
      "membership_level": "Gold"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
Updating a customer **merges** the data—existing attributes not included remain unchanged.
