Keeping customers informed about their account activities, such as points adjustments or new rewards, is essential for maintaining engagement. With the [Customer Notifications API](/api-reference/customers/notifications/list-customer-notifications), you can easily fetch, manage, and display these notifications in a clear and meaningful way.

## Step 1: Fetch Customer Notifications

Use the [Get Customer Notifications API](/api-reference/customers/notifications/list-customer-notifications) to fetch the customer notifications. This will return a list of notifications for the customer.

**Response Body:**

```json
{
    "notifications": [
        {
            "notificationId": "15227561",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "Buy over 500$ and get 10$ 💰 earned. Enjoy your rewards and keep earning more!",
            "isRead": false,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:39:13.792Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Client_9423/2b2efc2f-b85e-4cce-baf6-380454e4d62ccash.webp"
        },
        {
            "notificationId": "15227560",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "First Order earned. Enjoy your rewards and keep earning more!",
            "isRead": false,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:39:13.067Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Client_9423/1de5b89b-a7c4-44d9-a9cb-5e374e051938order.webp"
        }
    ],
    "count": 4,
    "hasMore": false
}
```

## Pagination in Customer Notifications

If your application involves displaying a large number of notifications, you can take advantage of **pagination** to break the notifications into manageable chunks. In the response, you'll see two useful attributes:

- **count**: The number of notifications returned in the current response
- **hasMore**: A boolean that indicates if there are more notifications that can be fetched

This allows you to implement a **paging system** in your UI, enabling users to navigate through pages of notifications.

## Customizing Notifications by Language

By default, notifications are returned in the system's default language, indicated by the **lang** attribute in the API response. However, if your customers want to see notifications in a different language, you can provide them the option to do so.

To fetch notifications in a different language, pass the desired language code as a query parameter:

```http
GET /api/v4.0/integrations/customers/{customerId}/notifications?lang=es
```

## Step 2: Mark Notifications as Read

When the customer views their notifications, you might want to mark them as read. This can be done through the [Mark Notifications as Read API](/api-reference/customers/notifications/mark-notifications-read). You'll need to pass the `notificationId` for each notification that you want to mark as read.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "notificationsIds": [15227561, 15227560]
}
```

**What Happens on the Frontend:**

- Once the notification is marked as read, update its status visually (e.g., changing the color or icon) to reflect that it's been read
