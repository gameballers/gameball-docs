VIP tiers are a fantastic way to reward your most loyal customers and keep them engaged. But to make the most of this feature, it's important to give customers a clear and motivating way to see their progress and the benefits waiting for them as they move up the tiers.

## Step 1: Fetch All Available Tiers

Use the [Get Tiers Configurations API](/api-reference/configurations/program-configurations/vip-tiers) to fetch the available tiers and their associated benefits. This endpoint returns the details of each tier, including the **name**, **icon**, **minimum progress required**, and **benefits** for each tier.

**Sample Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Basic",
        "minProgress": 0,
        "order": 1,
        "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/gb-library/levels-icons/level-a1.webp",
        "benefits": [
            {
                "type": "Entry Reward",
                "rankReward": 0,
                "walletReward": 0
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Bronze",
        "minProgress": 30,
        "order": 2,
        "icon": "level-a2",
        "benefits": [
            {
                "type": "Entry Reward",
                "rankReward": 0,
                "walletReward": 12,
                "couponReward": {
                    "couponType": "0",
                    "discountValue": null,
                    "minOrderValue": null,
                    "product": null,
                    "collections": []
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Loyalty Points Earning Custom Configuration",
                "rewardWalletFactor": 70.0
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Silver",
        "minProgress": 700,
        "order": 3,
        "icon": "level-a1",
        "benefits": []
    },
    {
        "name": "Gold",
        "minProgress": 6001,
        "order": 4,
        "icon": "level-a1",
        "benefits": []
    }
]
```

## Step 2: Fetch Customer Tier Progress

Use the [Get Customer Tier Progress API](/api-reference/customers/progress/get-customer-progress) to get the current progress of the logged-in customer.

**Sample Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "tierName": "Gold",
    "tierId": 1234,
    "completionPercentage": 50.0,
    "achievedPoints": 95,
    "nextTierProgress": 190
  },
  {
    "tierName": "Platinum",
    "tierId": 5678,
    "completionPercentage": 0.0,
    "achievedPoints": 0,
    "nextTierProgress": 500
  }
]
```

## Step 3: Combine Tiers and Progress for UI Display

After fetching both the tier configuration and the customer progress, you can combine the data to create an interactive and motivating display.

**Visual Suggestions:**

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Completed Tiers" icon="check-circle" color="#16a34a">
    Use a **green progress bar** to indicate a completed tier and show the **"Claim Benefits"** button for the customer to redeem rewards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="In-Progress Tiers" icon="clock" color="#ea580c">
    Use an **orange progress bar** for in-progress tiers, and show a button like **"Level Up"** or **"Keep Going!"** to encourage the customer to continue earning points.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Locked Tiers" icon="lock" color="#6b7280">
    Use a **gray progress bar** and show the message **"Locked"** in a faded style to indicate that the tier has not been reached.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Visuals for VIP Tiers:**

1. **Progress Bars**: Use colored progress bars: green for completed, orange for in-progress, and gray for locked
2. **Tier Icons**: Use tier-specific icons (golden badge, platinum badge) for easy recognition
3. **Benefits List**: Show a list of benefits for each tier, with any specific rewards and links to redeem or learn more about them
