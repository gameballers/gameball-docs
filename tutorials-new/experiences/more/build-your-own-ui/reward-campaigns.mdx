Reward campaigns are a great way to inspire and engage your customers. But to make them truly effective, customers need a simple and clear way to see what's available and how they're progressing.

## Step 1: Fetch All Available Reward Campaigns

Use the [Get Reward Campaigns Configurations API](/api-reference/configurations/program-configurations/campaigns) endpoint to list all active and visible campaigns. This response provides:

- **Campaign Name and Icon**: Display campaign names like "Join our family 👯‍♂️" and their corresponding icons
- **Description**: Use descriptions to explain the campaign
- **Rewards**: Highlight the rewards customers will earn, such as double points (`walletRewardFactor: 2`)
- **Visibility and Activation**: Ensure only visible and active campaigns are displayed based on `visibility` and `activation` fields

**Example Campaign Data:**

```json
{
    "id": 5858,
    "name": "Join our family 👯‍♂️",
    "description": "Welcome to the family! Check out your new reward for signing up 😉",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rankReward": 0,
            "walletReward": 0,
            "walletRewardFactor": null,
            "couponReward": null
        }
    ],
    "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/gb-library/general/signup.webp"
}
```

**What Happens on the Frontend:**

- Render the campaigns as a scrollable **grid or list**, with icons and descriptions
- Add a **"Check Your Rewards"** button using the `redirectionButtonText` and `redirectionButtonLink` fields

## Step 2: Fetch Customer Progress for Campaigns

To provide a personalized experience, fetch progress for the displayed campaigns using the [Get Customer Campaigns Progress API](/api-reference/customers/progress/get-customer-campaigns-progress). This response includes:

- **achievedCount**: Indicates how many times the customer has achieved the campaign
- **completionPercentage**: Shows progress for ongoing campaigns (e.g., 33% for "Third Order Campaign 🛍️")

**Example Progress Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "rewardsCampaignName": "Join our family 👯‍♂️",
        "rewardsCampaignId": 5858,
        "completionPercentage": 100.0,
        "achievedCount": 1
    },
    {
        "rewardsCampaignName": "Double points",
        "rewardsCampaignId": 6652,
        "completionPercentage": 50.0,
        "achievedCount": 0
    }
]
```

**What Happens on the Frontend:**

- Use **completionPercentage** to display progress as a **progress bar or circle**
- Highlight completed campaigns where `completionPercentage = 100` and dim or gray-out incomplete campaigns

</Frame>

## Step 3: Integrating Rewards and Progress

Combine data from both endpoints to create a seamless user experience:

**For Completed Campaigns:**

- Use `achievedCount` and `completionPercentage = 100` to highlight campaigns
- Show rewards (e.g., "Sign-up bonus unlocked!") prominently for completed campaigns

**For Ongoing Campaigns:**

- Use `completionPercentage` to display a progress bar (e.g., "50% complete")
- Include a call-to-action, such as "Complete your next purchase to earn double points!" using the campaign description or custom text

**Visual Mockup Suggestion:**

1. **Grid Layout of Campaigns**: Campaign name and icon at the top, progress bar or circle beneath the name, rewards displayed below the progress bar
2. **Color Coding**: Use green for completed campaigns, orange for in-progress, and gray for locked
3. **Actionable Buttons**: Include "Claim Reward" for completed campaigns or "Learn More" for ongoing ones
