Loyalty programs thrive when customers can easily see their rewards and understand their value. By using the [Get Customer Balance API](/api-reference/customers/progress/get-customer-balance), you can create a clear and motivating view of a customer's points balance, helping them track their earnings and see how close they are to redeeming rewards.
