Gameball provides the flexibility to customize how your customers access the loyalty widget. If the default widget button does not align with your platform’s theme or if space is limited, you can hide or replace the button and use **deep links** to give customers quick access to specific widget sections from anywhere on your platform.

This guide explains how to use deep links effectively and integrate them into your website, emails, or campaigns.

***

## What Are Deep Links?

Deep links are URLs or hyperlinks that navigate customers directly to a specific section of the Gameball widget. They enhance the user experience by allowing customers to access the desired content immediately, bypassing unnecessary steps.

## 💻 How to Use Deep Links on Web

You can use these links in two formats:

### 1. **Hash Format**

Append `#gameball-[section_key]` to your URL

```plaintext
https://your-site.com/#gameball-referral
https://your-site.com/#gameball-slot_123
```

### 2. **Query Parameter Format**

Append `?gameball-deep=[section_key]` to your URL

```plaintext
https://your-site.com/?gameball-deep=referral
https://your-site.com/?gameball-deep=slot_123
```

### 3. **JavaScript SDK (Web)**

Use this if you want to control the widget via JavaScript:

```javascript
GbSdk.toggleDeeps("toggle", "referral");
GbSdk.toggleDeeps("toggle", "slot_123");
```

***

## 📱 How to Use Deep Links on Mobile (via SDK)

In mobile apps (iOS/Android), use the `openDetail` parameter with the same section key but with the `details_` prefix.

```kotlin
gameballApp.showProfile(this, "customer_id", "details_referral", true)
gameballApp.showProfile(this, "customer_id", "details_slot_123", true)
```

***

## How to Use Deep Links

Deep links can be added to any element that supports hyperlinks, such as:

- Text
- Images
- Menu items
- Buttons

They can also be included in automated emails or SMS campaigns. For instance, if a customer clicks on a button labeled “View Your Points” in an email, they will be redirected to your website, and the Gameball widget will automatically display their points section.

***

## Available Deep Links

Here are the deep links Gameball provides to help you customize your user experience:

- `#gameball-home` – Takes customers to the home section and guests to the guest-view section.

## Implementation Guidelines

There are three ways to implement deep links, depending on your platform and requirements:

### 1. **Using the Hash Format (Web)**

You can append a `#gameball-[section-name]` hash to your website URL to navigate customers to specific sections of the widget.

```http
https://your-website.com/#gameball-[section-name]
```

**Examples**:

- Home section: `https://your-website.com/#gameball-home`
- Referral section: `https://your-website.com/#gameball-referral`

### **2. Using Query Parameters (Web)**

Alternatively, you can use the query parameter `?gameball-deep=[section-name]` to embed deep links into emails, SMS campaigns, or website navigation.

```http
https://your-website.com/?gameball-deep=[section-name]
```

**Examples**:

- Home section: `https://your-website.com/?gameball-deep=home`
- Referral section: `https://your-website.com/?gameball-deep=referral`

### 3. Programmatically Using Javascript

You can programmatically control the Gameball widget using `GbSdk.toggleDeeps("toggle", "[section-name]")` function.

```javascript
GbSdk.toggleDeeps("toggle", "referral");
```

This is useful for scenarios where you want to provide customers with a button to easily open the widget on your website.

### 4. **Using the SDK (Mobile Apps)**

For mobile apps, you can programmatically control the Gameball widget using our SDKs. Pass the `openDetail` parameter with specific values to navigate directly to various sections of the widget.

**Supported Values for `openDetail`**:

- `details_referral` – Opens the referral section.
- `details_redeem_coupons` – Navigates to the coupon redemption section.
- `details_earn` – Displays the list of reward campaigns.
- `details_reward_campaign_{CampaignID}` – Opens a specific reward campaign by its ID.

- `details_slot_{SlotID}` – Opens a specific slot machine by its ID.

**Example (Using the Android SDK)**:

```

This approach is tailored for mobile apps and ensures a seamless customer experience.
