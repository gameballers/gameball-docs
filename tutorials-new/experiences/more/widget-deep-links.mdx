---

Gameball provides the flexibility to customize how your customers access the loyalty widget. If the default widget button does not align with your platform’s theme or if space is limited, you can hide or replace the button and use **deep links** to give customers quick access to specific widget sections from anywhere on your platform.

This guide explains how to use deep links effectively and integrate them into your website, emails, or campaigns.

***

## What Are Deep Links?

Deep links are URLs or hyperlinks that navigate customers directly to a specific section of the Gameball widget. They enhance the user experience by allowing customers to access the desired content immediately, bypassing unnecessary steps.

## ✅ All Available Deep Links

Gameball supports the following deep links, which can be used across **both web and mobile** platforms. The section targets remain consistent; only the format changes depending on your platform.  
Use the compatibility table below to identify which sections can be reached through browser deep links versus SDK `openDetail` parameters:

- **Web Deep Link**: Navigates an already embedded widget to a specific section by using hash or query parameters.
- **SDK `openDetail`**: Initializes or launches the widget directly into a specific view (for example, a particular campaign or game) using the SDKs.

## How to Use Deep Links

Deep links can be added to any element that supports hyperlinks, such as:

- Text
- Images
- Menu items
- Buttons

They can also be included in automated emails or SMS campaigns. For instance, if a customer clicks on a button labeled “View Your Points” in an email, they will be redirected to your website, and the Gameball widget will automatically display their points section.

***

## Web (Deep links)

Deep links on the web rely on URL formats that the widget listens to. Use either of the following approaches based on how you expose the links to customers.

### Web-Compatible Section Keys

Use the section keys with either `#gameball-[section_key]` or `?gameball-deep=[section_key]`:


### Hash Format

Append `#gameball-[section_key]` to your URL:

```plaintext
https://your-site.com/#gameball-referral
https://your-site.com/#gameball-wheel
https://your-site.com/#gameball-games
```

### Query Parameter Format

Append `?gameball-deep=[section_key]` to your URL:

```plaintext
https://your-site.com/?gameball-deep=referral
https://your-site.com/?gameball-deep=wheel
https://your-site.com/?gameball-deep=games
```

***

## Our SDK

When you are using Gameball SDKs, you can trigger the same sections programmatically. The section keys from the table above still apply; the invocation syntax changes per SDK.

### Mobile SDKs (iOS / Android / React Native / Flutter)

Pass the section key using the `openDetail` parameter and prefix it with `details_`:

```kotlin
gameballApp.showProfile(this, "customer_id", "details_referral", true)
gameballApp.showProfile(this, "customer_id", "details_slot_123", true)
```


### Web SDKs

Pass the section key using the `openDetail` parameter and prefix it with `details_`:

```javascript
   GbSdk.init({
            APIKey: '{{Your_API_Key}}',
            lang: 'en',
            playerUniqueId: '',
            playerAttributes:{},
            openDetail: "details_referral"
        });
```
