description: 'Create a unified loyalty experience across all customer touchpoints using channel merging'
---


Create a seamless loyalty experience across all customer touchpoints—whether customers interact through your website, mobile app, physical stores, or other channels, Gameball's channel merging feature ensures they see consistent rewards and maintain a unified profile.

***

## Why Omni-Channel Matters

In multi-channel businesses, customers often interact through various touchpoints, each potentially using different customer IDs. Without channel merging, this can create fragmented experiences:

  <Card title="❌ Without Channel Merging" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#dc2626">
    **Fragmented Experience**
    - Same customer appears as separate profiles across channels
    - Points and rewards don't accumulate together
    - Inconsistent loyalty status across touchpoints
    - Customers miss out on unified rewards
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ With Channel Merging" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" color="#16a34a">
    **Unified Experience**
    - Single customer profile across all channels
    - All points and rewards consolidated
    - Consistent loyalty status everywhere
    - Seamless reward accumulation and redemption
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Channel Merging Works

Channel merging uses a secondary identifier (email or mobile number) alongside the customerId to recognize the same customer across different systems.

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose a Merging Identifier">
  Configure your Gameball account to use either **email** or **mobile number** as the merging identifier.
  
  <Info>
  Contact Gameball Support to enable channel merging, as it may be a premium feature. You can choose either email or mobile, but not both simultaneously.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Include Identifier in API Requests">
  Every API request from each channel should include:
  - The channel-specific `customerId`
  - The merging identifier (`email` or `mobile`) based on your configuration
  
  <Warning>
  **Required Field**: If your account uses email-based merging, you must include `email` in every API request. If using mobile-based merging, include `mobile`. Without the merging identifier, profiles won't be unified.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Gameball Unifies Profiles">
  Gameball automatically merges activities based on the secondary identifier, creating a single unified profile for loyalty tracking.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Customer Journey Example

Let's follow Sarah's journey across different channels to see how channel merging works:

### Scenario

Sarah shops with your brand across multiple channels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🌐 Online Store (Web)">
    Sarah visits your website and makes a purchase. Your web platform assigns her `customerId: "web_user_12345"`.
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Order Submission (Web)
    POST /api/v4.0/integrations/orders
    {
      "customerId": "web_user_12345",
      "email": "sarah@example.com",
      "channel": "web",
      "orderId": "ORD_WEB_001",
      "totalPaid": 150.00,
      "lineItems": [...]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    Sarah earns 150 points from this purchase.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="📱 Mobile App">
    Later, Sarah downloads your mobile app. The app assigns her a different ID: `customerId: "mobile_user_67890"`.
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Order Submission (Mobile)
    POST /api/v4.0/integrations/orders
    {
      "customerId": "mobile_user_67890",
      "email": "sarah@example.com",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "orderId": "ORD_MOB_001",
      "totalPaid": 200.00,
      "lineItems": [...]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    Sarah earns 200 points. With channel merging enabled, these points are added to her existing balance from the web purchase, giving her a total of 350 points.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🏪 In-Store POS">
    Sarah visits a physical store. The POS system assigns her yet another ID: `customerId: "pos_user_99999"`.
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Order Submission (POS)
    POST /api/v4.0/integrations/orders
    {
      "customerId": "pos_user_99999",
      "email": "sarah@example.com",
      "channel": "pos",
      "orderId": "ORD_POS_001",
      "totalPaid": 100.00,
      "lineItems": [...]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    Sarah earns 100 points. All three purchases are now unified under one profile with 450 total points.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Result**: Even though Sarah has three different customer IDs across channels, Gameball recognizes her through `sarah@example.com` and consolidates all her activities into a single profile with 450 total points.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Enable Channel Merging

Before implementing, ensure channel merging is enabled:

<Steps>
<Step title="Contact Gameball Support">
  Reach out to Gameball Support to enable channel merging for your account.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Merging Identifier">
  Decide whether to use **email** or **mobile number** as your merging identifier.
  
  <Tip>
  **Email-based merging** works well for businesses with email registration. **Mobile-based merging** is ideal for markets where phone numbers are more reliable identifiers.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Update API Requests

Include the merging identifier in all relevant API requests. Here's where it's typically needed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orders API">
    Include `email` or `mobile` when submitting orders:
    
    ```json
    {
      "customerId": "channel_specific_id",
      "email": "customer@example.com",  // if using email-based merging
      "channel": "web",
      "orderId": "ORD123",
      "totalPaid": 100.00,
      "lineItems": [...]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payments API">
    Include `email` or `mobile` when tracking payments:
    
    ```json
    {
      "customerId": "channel_specific_id",
      "email": "customer@example.com",  // if using email-based merging
      "channel": "mobile",
      "paymentId": "PAY123",
      "totalPaid": 50.00,
      "paymentDetails": [...]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Events API">
    Include `email` or `mobile` when tracking customer events:
    
    ```json
    {
      "customerId": "channel_specific_id",
      "email": "customer@example.com",  // if using email-based merging
      "events": {
        "profile_completed": {}
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create/Update Customer API">
    Include `email` or `mobile` when creating or updating customer profiles:
    
    ```json
    {
      "customerId": "channel_specific_id",
      "email": "customer@example.com",  // if using email-based merging
      "customerAttributes": {
        "displayName": "John Doe",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Test Across Channels

<Warning>
**Testing is Critical**: Before going live, test channel merging by making transactions from different channels with the same email or mobile number to verify profiles merge correctly.
</Warning>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use both email and mobile for merging?">
    No, you must choose either email or mobile as your merging identifier. Choose based on which identifier is more reliable and consistent across your channels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I forget to include the merging identifier?">
    Without the merging identifier, Gameball cannot merge profiles. Each channel-specific customerId will remain as a separate profile. Always include the merging identifier in your API requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my merging identifier later?">
    Changing your merging identifier after going live can be complex and may affect existing customer data. Contact Gameball Support to discuss migration strategies before making changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does channel merging work with guest checkout?">
    Yes, but you need to ensure the merging identifier is captured during guest checkout. Once the customer provides their email or mobile, include it in the API request to enable merging.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
