## Submitting an Order

Let's explore how the **Orders API** works, starting with what your customers experience and how their actions on your e-commerce platform interact with Gameball to trigger rewards and campaigns.

***

### Customer Journey

<Steps>
<Step title="Customer browses and adds items">
  A customer, Sarah, visits your e-commerce website and adds items to her cart.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer completes checkout">
  At checkout, she places an order for a pair of sneakers worth $500 and pays successfully.
</Step>

<Step title="Order is confirmed">
  Sarah's order is confirmed and your system communicates with Gameball.
</Step>
</Steps>

***

### What Happens in the Background

<Info>
**Order Details Sent to Gameball**

The moment Sarah's order is completed, your website communicates with Gameball through the **Orders API**. This triggers a `place_order` event in the background, sending details like:

**Order Information:**
```json
{
  "orderId": "ORD12345",
  "orderDate": "2024-10-16T08:13:29.290Z",
  "totalPaid": 500.4,
  "totalPrice": 500.4,
  "totalShipping": 0.4
}
```

**Products Purchased:**
```json
{
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "price": 120,
      "quantity": 1,
      "productId": "PROD98765",
      "sku": "SKU98765",
      "title": "Black Sneakers",
      "category": ["Shoes"],
      "collection": ["Summer2024"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Customer Information:**
```json
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816"
}
```

**Complete Order Request:**

  "totalPaid": 500.4,
  "totalPrice": 500.4,
  "totalShipping": 0.4,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "price": 500,
      "quantity": 1,
      "productId": "PROD98765",
      "sku": "SKU98765",
      "title": "Black Sneakers",
      "category": ["Shoes"],
      "collection": ["Summer2024"]
    }
  ]
}
```
</Info>

### Gameball Processing

Once the `place_order` event is triggered:

<Steps>
<Step title="Order data mapping">
  The Orders API automatically sends the order details to Gameball with the following mapping for the order event metadata:

  | Order API Attribute      | Mapped to Event Object Attribute |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
  | totalPaid                | total_paid                        |
  | totalDiscount            | total_discount                    |
  | lineItems[i].weight      | weight                            |
  | lineItems[i].vendor      | vendor                            |
  | lineItems[i].sku         | sku                               |
  | lineItems[i].title       | title                             |
  | lineItems[i].tag         | tag                               |
  | lineItems[i].category    | category                          |
  | lineItems[i].collection  | collection                        |
  | extra.key[0]:value       | key[0]:value                      |
</Step>

<Step title="Campaign evaluation">
  Gameball evaluates the order metadata based on your configured campaigns.
</Step>

<Step title="Rewards issued">
  Sarah earns rewards, such as cashback or loyalty points, based on your Gameball settings.

  <Check>
  For example, if you've configured a rewards campaign for customers placing their first order, Sarah earns a $20 amount-based coupon as a reward.

</Step>
</Steps>

***

### Seamless Automation

<Tip>
The **Orders API** eliminates extra work by:

- Automatically triggering rewards based on Sarah's purchase (no need for manual event creation)
- Connecting the order to multiple Gameball modules, such as cashback or campaign tracking
</Tip>

**For instance:**

- If Sarah qualifies for cashback, Gameball calculates the amount and updates her balance instantly and you can display it using the Get Customer Balance API.

</Frame>

<Info>
This image showcases the Gameball widget displaying the customer's balance. You can also retrieve the same information programmatically using the **Get Customer Balance API** for seamless integration with your application.
</Info>

- If you're sending order-based notifications, Sarah might receive a message like: "Congratulations, Sarah! You've earned 100 points for your last order."

### Customer Experience

Sarah's experience remains smooth and rewarding:

1. She places an order without any extra steps
2. She receives instant confirmation about her reward points or cashback, enhancing her satisfaction
3. Over time, Sarah can redeem these points for discounts, keeping her engaged and loyal to your brand

***

### Why This Matters

By integrating the Orders API:

- You provide a **seamless customer experience** while keeping them engaged with rewards
- You **streamline internal processes**, saving time with automatic data mapping and event creation
- You gain the flexibility to tie specific orders or products to targeted campaigns, driving sales effectively

***

## Redeeming Points During Order Submission

Imagine a customer excited to redeem their hard-earned points while placing an order, but still wanting the freedom to browse and add more items to their cart before completing the purchase. With Gameball's redemption process, you can make this experience smooth and hassle-free by temporarily holding their points.

***

### Customer Journey

Let's explore how this works: Sarah has earned loyalty points and is now ready to redeem them for a discount on her order. She has 50 points and wants to redeem them for her current cart.

<Steps>
<Step title="Customer selects redemption option">
  Sarah selects the option to redeem 50 points during checkout.
</Step>

<Step title="Points are held">
  The system reserves the points for her transaction, allowing her to continue shopping without losing them.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer completes order">
  Sarah finishes browsing and proceeds to complete her order with the held points applied.
</Step>
</Steps>

***

### API Flow

<Info>
**How Points Are Held**

The moment Sarah opts to redeem her points, the **Hold Points API** is triggered in the background.

This request will:
- **Reserve** 50 points from Sarah's balance, ensuring they are locked for the order
- Generate a **hold reference ID**, which is used to track the redemption
- Allow Sarah to continue shopping freely without worrying that her points will be lost
</Info>

Once Sarah is ready to complete her order, the points will be applied to her purchase. The redemption is completed by using the **hold reference ID** to link the held points to the final transaction.

***

### Example API Interaction

<CodeGroup>
```json Hold Points Request
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816",
  "transactionTime": "2024-10-11T16:15:15.071Z",
  "pointsToHold": 50
}
```

```json Hold Points Response
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816",
  "holdAmount": null,
  "holdEquivalentPoints": 50,
  "holdReference": "a2a199ad-86f3-45c4-8253-7aaee50e4798"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

***

### Linking Held Points to the Order

Once Sarah completes her order, the **Hold Points API** response provides a **hold reference ID**. This reference ID is then used to link the held points to the order during the submission process.

<CodeGroup>
```json Order Request with Held Points
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816",
  "orderId": "ORD987654321",
  "orderDate": "2024-10-11T16:45:00.000Z",
  "totalPaid": 200,
  "totalPrice": 250,
  "totalShipping": 0,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productId": "Naomi-Pastel",
      "price": 200,
      "quantity": 1,
      "collection": ["Bags"]
    }
  ],
  "redemption": {
    "pointsHoldReference": "a2a199ad-86f3-45c4-8253-7aaee50e4798"
  }
}
```

```json Order Response
{
  "customerId": "cust_abc12345xyz67890",
  "orderId": "ORD987654321",
  "totalPaid": 200,
  "totalPrice": 250,
  "redeemedPoints": 50
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The **redemption** object contains the **pointsHoldReference**, ensuring that the 50 held points are applied to the final order.
</Note>

***

### Customer Experience

- **Points Reserved**: Sarah sees that her 50 points have been securely held for her order
- **Seamless Order Completion**: As she proceeds, the points are automatically applied, reducing the total paid amount
- **Flexible Shopping**: Sarah continues to browse and add items to her cart without losing the points she's already reserved

The ability to hold points ensures that Sarah can make purchases confidently without feeling rushed.

***

### Why This Matters

<Tip>
**Benefits of Point Holds:**

- **Convenience for Customers**: Redeem points without rushing through the order process
- **Secure Redemption**: Points are securely held, eliminating worry about losing them
- **Flexibility**: Redemption is applied seamlessly when ready to complete the order
</Tip>

By offering a smooth and flexible points redemption process, you not only enhance the customer's journey but also build greater trust and satisfaction.

***

## Using Coupon Codes During Order Submission

Using coupon codes during order submission is an effective way to enhance the customer experience and boost sales. By validating and locking a coupon code, businesses can ensure that the discount is reserved exclusively for the customer, eliminating any risk of overuse or misuse.

<Tip>
This feature is particularly valuable during high-demand campaigns or limited-time promotions, as locking the coupon creates urgency and encourages faster purchasing decisions.
</Tip>

***

### Customer Journey

Let's see how this works:

<Steps>
<Step title="Customer has a coupon">
  Sarah is browsing your website and has a coupon code, offering her **10% off**.
  
  <Frame>
  <img src="https://873157020-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FElcuAgxn15Pk6F2fINKe%2Fuploads%2FS6WpEkOgDgpklxMXBp0r%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=61fca429-1552-42d6-872b-17d49e4cd557" alt="Coupon shown on site" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Customer enters coupon code">
  She decides to use the coupon and proceeds to checkout, where she enters her coupon code.
  
  <Frame>
  <img src="https://873157020-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FElcuAgxn15Pk6F2fINKe%2Fuploads%2FOriPWunIjpaF9Bq19BQF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=477a5ad6-6da1-4f14-9786-2071ffd28702" alt="Customer enters coupon code at checkout" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Coupon is validated and locked">
  The system validates and locks the coupon for her exclusive use.
  
  <Check>
  Once the coupon is locked, Sarah can continue browsing and adding products to her cart, knowing that the coupon will be applied when she finalizes her order.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

***

### API Flow

<Info>
**Validating and Locking Coupons**

The moment Sarah enters her coupon code, the **Validate Coupon API** is triggered in the background with the **lock** flag set to `true`.

This request:
- **Validates** the coupon code provided by Sarah
- **Locks** the coupon for her use, ensuring it cannot be used by anyone else during the session
- Returns a **lock reference** to track the coupon during the order submission process
</Info>

Once Sarah is ready to complete her order, the coupon is securely locked and can be applied to her final purchase.

***

### Example API Interaction

<CodeGroup>
```json Validate Coupon Request
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816",
  "coupons": [
    "tKpLMD0NyP"
  ],
  "lock": true
}
```

```json Validate Coupon Response

        "shippingDiscounts": true
      }
    }
  ],

  "dateToExpire": "2024-10-20T16:22:00.8249283Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The response confirms that the coupon code is valid and locked for Sarah's session. The **lockReference** is provided to ensure the coupon can be applied during order submission.
</Note>

***

### Linking the Locked Coupon to the Order

When Sarah is ready to finalize her purchase, the **lockReference** returned in the **Validate Coupon Response** will be included in the order API request to apply the coupon to her final order.

```json Order Request with Locked Coupon
{
  "customerId": "15327289462816",
  "orderId": "ORD987654321",
  "orderDate": "2024-10-11T16:45:00.000Z",
  "totalPaid": 1080.40,
  "totalPrice": 1200.40,
  "totalShipping": 0.40,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productId": "Hobo-bag",
      "price": 1200,
      "quantity": 1,
      "collection": ["Bags"]
    }
  ],
  "redemption": {
    "couponsLockReference": "74e20fc6bf7a4970ad3c125b1713194f"
  }
}
```

<Note>
The **couponsLockReference** ensures that the locked coupon is applied to the order when Sarah completes the submission.
</Note>
