<Note>
  This is an advanced order handling scenario. If you're new to order integration, start with [Submitting Orders](/tutorials-new/experiences/order-handling/submit-order) first.
</Note>

Manage loyalty programs across multiple locations, franchises, or merchants.

<Info>
  For businesses with multiple brands, physical stores, online shops, or franchises, Gameball enables you to **segment customer transactions by merchant and branch**.
</Info>

This ensures:

- Accurate reward tracking
- Campaign targeting at a granular level
- Reliable performance reporting across all entities

The `merchant` object in the **Order API** allows you to:

- Attribute the order to a **specific merchant** (e.g., brand or business unit)
- Specify the **branch** (e.g., store location or sales channel)

---

## Why It Matters

- **Branch-Specific Promotions**: enable campaigns like _“Double Points in Mall Branches”_
- **Multi-Brand Support**: helps groups manage loyalty across brands within one Gameball workspace
- **Accurate Tracking**: ensures correct order attribution for rewards, redemptions, and analytics

  <Warning>
    Without the `merchant object:`
    - Gameball assumes the transaction is from the **default entity**
    - You lose the ability to analyze or control loyalty flows by brand or location
  </Warning>

---

## Tech Implementation

To support this use case, include the `merchant` object in your **Order API** payload as shown below.

### Example 1: Physical Retail Store Transaction

Let’s say a customer places an order at your physical store, which belongs to your **“Glow Up”** brand.

```json
{
  "orderId": "ORD_20230912",
  "customerId": "CUST_88991",
  "totalPaid": 1200,
  "totalPrice": 1200,
  "totalShipping": 0,
  "totalTax": 40,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productId": "PROD_FACE_CREAM",
      "price": 400,
      "quantity": 2,
      "collection": ["Skin Care"],
      "taxes": 20
    },
    {
      "productId": "PROD_EYE_SERUM",
      "price": 400,
      "quantity": 1,
      "collection": ["Premium"],
      "taxes": 20
    }
  ],
  "merchant": {
    "uniqueId": "UB001",
    "name": "UrbanBay",
    "branch": {
      "uniqueId": "downtown-branch",
      "name": "Downtown Branch"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Business with Both Online and Offline Channels

Let’s say your business operates both:

- 🏬 A **physical store** in the Downtown Branch
- 🌐 An **online website**

To track these channels separately, use **`different branchId values`** while keeping the same `merchantId`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🌐 Online Order Example">
    ```json
    {
      "merchant": {
        "uniqueId": "UB001",
        "name": "UrbanBay",
        "branch": {
          "uniqueId": "web-store",
          "name": "Online Store"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="🏬 Offline Store Example">
    ```json
    {
     "merchant": {
       "uniqueId": "UB001",
       "name": "UrbanBay",
       "branch": {
         "uniqueId": "downtown-branch",
         "name": "Downtown Branch"
       }
     }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Takeaway

<Check>
    Use the `merchant` object to identify which brand or channel each transaction belongs to.
</Check>

**Always include both:**

- 🏷️ **merchantId**: identifies the brand or business unit
- 🏠 **branchId**: distinguishes between physical and online channels

Including both ensures **consistent tracking** across all customer touchpoints and enables accurate reward and campaign reporting.
