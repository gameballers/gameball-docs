# Overview

Some businesses prefer to reward customers only on the **actual product value**, excluding **shipping fees** and **taxes** from the rewardable amount.\
Gameball supports this behavior through a configurable setting.

If enabled, Gameball will automatically **subtract tax and shipping values** before calculating the reward amount.

---

## Why This Matters

Let’s say your customer pays \$100, but \$20 of that is tax and shipping. If you don’t exclude these values, your loyalty program will over-reward, giving points for money not actually spent on products.

That’s why, if you choose to exclude tax and shipping, it’s critical to send **complete and accurate values** in the [**Order API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/order/order-tracking), including:

- `totalShipping`: The total shipping fee paid by the customer
- `totalTax`: The total tax across all items
- `taxes`: At the item level, represents the total tax for each product line (`price × quantity`)

<Tip>
  Even though the API doesn’t enforce these fields, they become mandatory when **tax and shipping exclusions** are turned on.

### Example Scenario:

Let’s say a customer places this order:

- 2 × Moisturizer at **\$200 each** → **Subtotal = \$400**
- 1 × Tote Bag at **\$150**
- Shipping Fee = **\$50**
- Tax on Moisturizer = **10 = \$20**
- Tax on Tote Bag = **\$15**
- Total Tax = **15 = \$35**
- **Total Paid = 150 + 35 = \$635**

### Your API Payload

```json
{
  "orderId": "ORD-10001",
  "customerId": "CUST_56789",
  "totalPaid": 635,
  "totalPrice": 635,
  "totalShipping": 50,
  "totalTax": 35,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productId": "PROD_MOISTURIZER",
      "price": 200,
      "quantity": 2,
      "collection": ["Skin Care"],
      "taxes": 20
    },
    {
      "productId": "PROD_TOTE_BAG",
      "price": 150,
      "quantity": 1,
      "collection": ["Accessories"],
      "taxes": 15
    }
  ]
}
```

## How Gameball Calculates Rewards

With **tax and shipping exclusions** turned on, Gameball calculates the **rewardable amount** as follows:

1. **Start with:** `totalPaid = $635`
2. **Subtract shipping:** `$635 – $50 = $585`
3. **Subtract tax:** `$585 – $35 = $550`

<Info>
  Gameball rewards will be calculated based on **\$550** — the actual product value.

## Key Takeaways

<Note>
    Gameball ensures customers are rewarded accurately, only for the**true value of products** .
</Note>

**Remember to:**

- Include `totalShipping`, `totalTax`, and per-line `taxes` when this feature is active
- Ensure the `taxes` field in each `lineItem` represents the **total tax for that product line** (`unit tax × quantity`)
- Keep your data complete and consistent to guarantee precise reward calculations
