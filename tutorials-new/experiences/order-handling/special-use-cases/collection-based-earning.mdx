# Collection-Based Earning Rules

## What Are Collection-Based Earning Rules?

<Info>
  Gameball allows you to configure **campaigns that reward customers based on specific product collections.** These collections can represent different product groups or promotional categories that align with your loyalty strategy.
</Info>

### Examples of Collection Types

- **Evergreen categories:** ‚ÄúT-Shirts,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccessories,‚Äù ‚ÄúFace Products‚Äù
- **Seasonal or promotional groups:** ‚ÄúHoliday Bundles,‚Äù ‚ÄúClearance Items‚Äù

### Campaign Examples

- ‚ÄúEarn **50 bonus points** on every purchase from the _T-Shirts_ collection.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúGet **10% cashback** when buying items from the _Premium Skincare_ line.‚Äù

These **targeted campaigns** help personalize the reward experience and align loyalty incentives with your overall product strategy.

---

## Why It Matters

<Warning>
  When a campaign targets specific collections, Gameball must know **which collection each product belongs to**. If the collection data isn‚Äôt sent in the API payload, Gameball applies the **default earning rule** instead.
</Warning>

This means:

- The product **won‚Äôt qualify** for the intended collection-specific reward,
- Even if it technically belongs to that collection in your catalog.

This can affect both **customer experience** and **campaign performance**, since customers may not receive the rewards you planned for those product groups.

---

## How to Implement It

When sending an order using the [Track Order API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/order/order-tracking), make sure to populate the `lineItems` array with detailed product data.\
For each item, include its `collection` value so Gameball can correctly evaluate reward eligibility and apply campaign logic.

<Tip>
  Adding collection data ensures Gameball matches each product to its relevant **campaign rules** during evaluation.
</Tip>

### Example

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve configured a campaign:

> **‚ÄúEarn 50 bonus points for every product purchased from the ‚ÄòT-Shirts‚Äô collection.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs how your `Track Order` API payload should look:

```json
{
  "customerId": "12345",
  "orderId": "ORD-1001",
  "orderDate": "2025-10-16T13:06:34.967Z",
  "totalPaid": 1702.01,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productId": "TSH-001",
      "productName": "Classic T-Shirt",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 25,
      "collection": "T-Shirts"
    },
    {
      "productId": "SKN-010",
      "productName": "Premium Face Cream",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 120,
      "collection": "Premium Skincare"
    },
    {
      "productId": "ACC-008",
      "productName": "Basic Belt",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 20
      // No collection provided here
    }
  ],
  "channel": "web"
}
```

<Info>
  If a product belongs to a campaign-targeted collection, include the `collection`

  field. If it‚Äôs omitted (as in the third item), only the default earning rule applies.
</Info>

## What Happens Here?

<Info>
  This section illustrates how Gameball evaluates products during a transaction when different collections and campaign rules are in play.
</Info>

<Accordion title="üß¢ Product 1: T-Shirts (quantity 2)">
  <div style={{ paddingLeft:"12px" }}>
  The campaign applies **50 points √ó 2 = 100 bonus points**.\
  Each item in the same collection inherits the same reward logic, so multiplying by quantity gives the total bonus applied for this product line.

  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üß¥ Product 2: Premium Skincare (quantity 1)">
  <div style={{ paddingLeft:"12px" }}>
  If there‚Äôs a **separate campaign** targeting this collection ‚Äî for example, a **cashback offer** ‚Äî Gameball evaluates and applies that rule independently.\
  This allows overlapping campaigns across collections without conflict.

  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üì¶ Product 3: No Collection Sent">
  <div style={{ paddingLeft:"12px" }}>
  When no collection information is provided, **Gameball falls back to the default earning rule**.\
  Even if the product technically belongs to a targeted collection in your catalog, it won‚Äôt inherit those rules unless the collection reference is included in the request.

  </div>
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  To ensure campaigns apply correctly, always include **collection data** in your order or item payloads.\\

  This helps Gameball evaluate all active rules precisely.
</Tip>

## Key Takeaway

<Info>
  Whenever you run **collection-based campaigns**, make sure each product‚Äôs `collection` value is included in the order payload.
</Info>

It‚Äôs a small but crucial detail that ensures:

- **Accurate reward calculation**: every product earns the right amount of points
- **Reliable campaign performance tracking**: results reflect real customer behavior
- **A smoother, fairer loyalty experience**: customers get rewarded exactly as intended
