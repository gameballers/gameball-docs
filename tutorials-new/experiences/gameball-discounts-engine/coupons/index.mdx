Gameball’s discounts engine lets you manage coupons from lookup to final redemption. Use these guides to cover the full lifecycle:

- [Retrieve Coupons](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/coupons/retrieve) – list active, expired, or locked coupons for any customer.
- [Validate & Lock Coupons](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/coupons/validate-lock) – confirm eligibility and lock codes before checkout.
- [Burn Coupons](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/coupons/burn) – finalize successful orders across web, POS, or payment flows.
- [Release Coupons](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/coupons/release) – free locked coupons when orders are cancelled or fail.
