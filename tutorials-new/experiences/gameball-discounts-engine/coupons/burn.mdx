# Burn Coupon API

After a coupon is validated and applied, its redemption flow isn’t complete until it’s **burned**. This final step confirms the discount was successfully used and ensures it can’t be redeemed again.

Burning a coupon finalizes the process in Gameball’s discount engine, updating its lifecycle status from _locked_ to _used_, and keeping your discounts, analytics, and customer rewards accurate.

---

## Overview

In Gameball’s coupon lifecycle, the [**Burn Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) is the final confirmation step that marks a coupon as fully redeemed after a successful order or payment.

You’ll typically call this API right after:

- The **payment succeeds**, or
- The **order is submitted and confirmed**, or
- A **POS or fintech transaction** completes successfully.

If the transaction fails or gets canceled, you should instead use the [Release Coupon API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/release-coupons) to free the coupon for reuse.

## When and Where to Use It

The [**Burn Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) applies across different business contexts:

| Channel                   | Example Use                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🛍️ **E-commerce**        | Finalize a discount coupon after successful checkout.                    |
| 🏪 **POS (Retail)**       | Confirm in-store coupon redemption once the sale is processed.           |
| 💳 **Fintech / Payments** | Apply discounts or cashback coupons to payments, bills, or service fees. |

---

## **Customer Experience**

From a customer’s perspective, the burn process happens silently behind the scenes — right after they complete payment.

What they experience is a seamless, one-time coupon redemption that:

- Reflects an accurate discount in the payment summary,
- Prevents reuse of single-use or limited-use coupons, and
- Keeps their rewards and cashback history accurate in their profile.

## **Use Case 1: E-commerce Checkout Completion**

**Scenario:**

After Sarah completes her order using the coupon **WINTER20**, the payment gateway confirms success.

Your backend now needs to finalize the coupon redemption to ensure WINTER20 can’t be reused.

### **How to Implement**

Once the order status is confirmed as “paid,” call the [**Burn Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) using:

- The customerId
- The couponCodes
- The couponsLockReference (returned when the coupon was validated or locked)

#### **Example Request**

```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST_1123",
  "couponCodes": ["WINTER20"],
  "couponsLockReference": "lock-47bc79a1-c4b3-4a77-8b61-f9a32f9ef98a"
}
```

#### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "burnedCoupons": [
    {
      "code": "WINTER20",
      "burnedAt": "2025-02-20T12:30:00Z",
      "discountType": "Percentage",
      "discountValue": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Use Case 2: POS Redemption at Physical Stores**

**Scenario:**

Omar visits a retail store and uses his **LOYALTY10** coupon at checkout.

Once the cashier confirms the sale in the POS, the coupon should be marked as consumed.

### **How to Implement**

Your POS backend should call the [**Burn Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) once the transaction is finalized.

#### **Example Request**

```json
{
  "customerId": "POS_880",
  "couponCodes": ["LOYALTY10"],
  "couponsLockReference": "lock-17a9bc73-9c2b-4f1d-80a3-b3ab3e07b3d1"
}
```

#### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "burnedCoupons": [
    {
      "code": "LOYALTY10",
      "burnedAt": "2025-02-20T14:10:00Z",
      "discountType": "FixedAmount",
      "discountValue": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Best Practice**

- Ensure the coupon is **validated and locked** before burning.
- Use synchronized timestamps between POS and Gameball to keep transaction records aligned.

## **Use Case 3: Payment-Based Redemption (Fintech or Services)**

**Scenario:**

A fintech app offers a **SAR 20 discount** on a customer’s next wallet top-up using **BILLPAY20**.

Once the top-up succeeds, the system should burn the coupon to finalize redemption.

### **Why This Matters**

In service-based platforms, there’s no “cart” or “order.” Coupons apply directly to **payments, invoices, or subscriptions**, so burning them ensures accurate usage across non-ecommerce flows.

### **How to Implement**

After confirming a successful payment through the [Payment Tracking API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/payment/payment-tracking), call the [**Burn Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) just as you would after an e-commerce order.

#### **Example Request**

```json
{
  "customerId": "USER_FINTECH_001",
  "couponCodes": ["BILLPAY20"],
  "couponsLockReference": "lock-8b6c3a9d-f9ac-4e7c-99b0-3c0e820ae77e"
}
```

#### **Example Response**

```bash
{
  "status": "success",
  "burnedCoupons": [
    {
      "code": "BILLPAY20",
      "discountType": "FixedAmount",
      "discountValue": 20,
      "appliedOn": "Payment",
      "burnedAt": "2025-02-20T16:40:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Best Practices**

<Check>
  Burn only **after payment success**, never before.
</Check>

<Check>
  Always use the **latest** `couponsLockReference` for the same coupon.
</Check>

<Check>
  If payment fails, use the [**Release Coupon API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/release-coupons) instead.
