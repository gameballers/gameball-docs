# Retrieve Promotions

Retrieving a customer’s available promotions allows your platform to display active offers, personalized deals, or rewards-based discounts in real time.\
This API lets you showcase ongoing promotions directly within your **storefront**, **mobile app**, or **POS system**, empowering customers to redeem their offers at checkout.

---

## Overview

The [**Get Customer Coupons API**](/api-reference/customers/management/get-customer-coupons) returns all **promotions** assigned to a customer, including both active and expired ones.

Each promotion includes details such as:

- 🏷️ **Promotion name and type**
- 💰 **Discount value or benefit**
- 📅 **Expiry date and status**
- 🎯 **Eligibility and usage limits**

This API is ideal for building personalized **“My Promotions”** sections or showing available promotions at checkout.

## Important: Filtering Is Done on Your End

Gameball’s Promo Engine returns **all promotions** associated with the customer — whether they’re active, expired, or already used.\
To show only the valid ones, you’ll need to filter them on your side using the attributes provided in the API response.

| Attribute               | Description                                                                  | Usage Recommendation                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`isExpired`**         | `true` if the promotion’s expiry date has passed.                            | Exclude expired promotions from the main display or show them under an “Expired” section. |
| **`isActive`**          | `true` if the promotion is currently active in Gameball.                     | Display only active promotions.                                                           |
| **`usageLimit`**        | Maximum number of times this promotion can be used globally.                 | Compare with `usedCount` to check remaining availability.                                 |
| **`limitPerCustomer`**  | Number of times each customer can redeem the promotion.                      | Compare with `customerUsedCount` to decide eligibility.                                   |
| **`usedCount`**         | Total number of times this promotion has been redeemed globally.             | Useful for analytics or visibility into overall usage.                                    |
| **`customerUsedCount`** | Number of times this specific customer has redeemed the promotion.           | Use to determine if the customer can use it again.                                        |
| **`isAvailableToUse`**  | `true` if the promotion is currently valid and redeemable for this customer. | Main flag for determining usability in your UI.                                           |

<Tip>
  Use \<code\>`isAvailableToUse` as the key flag to show active, valid promotions.  

  For more precision, combine it with `isExpired`,`customerUsedCount`, and `limitPerCustomer` in your display logic.
</Tip>

## When to Use It

| Channel             | Example Use                                                          |

## Example Scenario: Showing Promotions in Checkout

When a customer signs in, your system can fetch all available promotions from Gameball and display those that are currently active and usable.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch promotions">
    Call the [Get Customer Coupons API](/api-reference/customers/management/get-customer-coupons) using the customer’s `customerId`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter the response">
    Use the metadata flags (`isExpired,isActive, isAvailableToUse`) to filter out inactive or used promotions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Display in the UI">
    Show filtered, valid promotions so customers can easily apply them at checkout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Request

```bash
GET /integrations/customers/{customerId}/promotions
```

### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "coupons": [
    {
      "code": "WELCOME20",
      "name": "Welcome Offer",
      "type": "percentage_discount",
      "value": 20,
      "expiryDate": "2025-07-01T23:59:59Z",
      "isExpired": false,
      "isActive": true,
      "usageLimit": 500,
      "limitPerCustomer": 1,
      "usedCount": 120,
      "customerUsedCount": 0,
      "isAvailableToUse": true
    },
    {
      "code": "LOYALTYBOOST",
      "name": "Loyalty Booster",
      "type": "fixed_discount",
      "value": 15,
      "expiryDate": "2025-03-01T23:59:59Z",
      "isExpired": true,
      "isActive": true,
      "usageLimit": 100,
      "limitPerCustomer": 1,
      "usedCount": 100,
      "customerUsedCount": 1,
      "isAvailableToUse": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Filtering Logic Example**

You can apply simple client-side filtering to show only the promotions available for redemption:

```jsx
const validCoupons = coupons.filter(
  (coupon) =>
    coupon.isActive &&
    !coupon.isExpired &&
    coupon.isAvailableToUse &&
    coupon.customerUsedCount < coupon.limitPerCustomer
);
```

This ensures customers see promotions that are:

<Checklist>
  <Check>Active</Check>
  <Check>Not expired</Check>
  <Check>Not used beyond their limits</Check>
  <Check>Available for redemption</Check>
</Checklist>

<Note>
  Optionally, group promotions by state, for example: **Active**, **Used**, and **Expired**, to create a cleaner user experience.
</Note>
