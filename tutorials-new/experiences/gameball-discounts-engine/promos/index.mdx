Promotions pair customer targeting with automated redemption flows in the Gameball discounts engine. Start here:

- [Retrieve Promotions](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/promos/retrieve) – inspect assigned promo balances and usage history.
- [Apply Promotions Automatically](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/promos/apply-automatically) – trigger promos during checkout without manual codes.
- [Burn or Submit Promotions](/tutorials-new/experiences/gameball-discounts-engine/promos/burn-submit) – confirm redemptions or complete orders using locked promos.
