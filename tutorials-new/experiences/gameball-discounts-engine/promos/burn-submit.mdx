# Burn API

After a promotion is validated and applied, its redemption flow isn’t complete until it’s **burned**.\
This final step confirms that the promotion was successfully used, ensuring it cannot be reused and that your analytics, limits, and reward logic remain accurate.

Burning a promotion finalizes its lifecycle inside Gameball’s **Promo Engine** by marking it as **used**, ensuring transparent tracking and reliable customer data.

---

## Overview

In Gameball’s **Promo Engine**, the [**Burn API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) serves as the **final confirmation step** that marks a promotion as redeemed after a successful order or payment.

You should call this API once the transaction is **successfully completed**, such as when:

- A payment is confirmed
- An order is submitted and verified
- A POS or fintech transaction completes successfully

If the transaction fails, gets canceled, or times out, use the [**Release API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/release-coupons) instead to free the locked promotion.

---

## Before You Burn: Validate First

Before any promotion can be finalized (burned), it **must first be validated** using the\
[**Validate API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/validate-single-coupon).

This validation step is essential because it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirms eligibility">
    Ensures the promotion is active and applicable to the customer, transaction, and cart context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generates a lock reference">
    Returns a unique `lockReference`; this must be included in all burn or order redemption requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Always validate promotions just before checkout. Use the returned `lockReference` when:

  - Calling the[ Burn API ](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon)after successful payment, or
  - Sending the [Order API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/order/order-tracking) with `couponsLockReference` for automatic burning.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you skip validation or use an expired `lockReference`  the burn or redemption request will fail, and the promotion won’t apply.
</Warning>

## **Use Case 1: Burn Promotion After Checkout**

### **Scenario**

After Sarah completes her order using the **WEEKEND10** promotion, the payment gateway confirms success.

Your backend must now finalize the promotion redemption to ensure it cannot be reused.

### **How to Implement**

Once the payment is confirmed, call the [**Burn API**](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon) with:

- `customerId`: the customer’s unique identifier
- code(s): the applied promotion code(s), this is shared as a path parameter
- `lockReference`: the lock reference from the validation step

#### **Example Request**

```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST_1123",
  "promotionCodes": ["WEEKEND10"],
  "couponsLockReference": "lock-47bc79a1-c4b3-4a77-8b61-f9a32f9ef98a"
}
```

#### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "burnedPromotions": [
    {
      "code": "WEEKEND10",
      "burnedAt": "2025-03-10T15:20:00Z",
      "discountType": "Percentage",
      "discountValue": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Use Case 2: Apply & Burn a Promotion via the Order API**

### **Scenario**

For a smoother checkout, you can finalize promotions automatically when creating an order.

**Prerequisite:** the promotion must first be validated using the [**Validate Promotion API**](/api-reference/coupons/validate-single-coupon) to obtain the `couponsLockReference`

### **Flow**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate the promotion">
    Call the [Validate API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/validate-single-coupon) with the promotion code and customer data. The response includes a lockReference that temporarily locks this promotion for checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit the order (auto-burn)">
    Send the [Order API ](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/order/order-tracking)request, including the `couponsLockReference`. Once the order succeeds, Gameball automatically burns the promotion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If payment fails or order is canceled">
    Use the [Release API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/release-coupons) to unlock the promotion for reuse. Or wait until the configured lock duration expires.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Example Flow**

#### **Step 1: Validate the Promotion**

```json
// POST /integrations/coupons/{code}/validate
{
  "customerId": "CUST_4412"
}
```

#### **Response**:

```json
{
  "status": "valid",
  "lockReference": "lock-47bc79a1-c4b3-4a77-8b61-f9a32f9ef98a"
}
```

#### **Step 2: Create Order (Auto-Burn)**

```json
// POST /integrations/orders
{
  "customerId": "CUST_4412",
  "orderId": "ORD_9001",
  "totalPaid": 250.0,
  "orderDate": "2025-03-10T12:45:00Z",
  "redemption": {
    "couponsLockReference": "lock-47bc79a1-c4b3-4a77-8b61-f9a32f9ef98a"
  },
  "lineItems": [
    { "productId": "TSH001", "price": 125.0, "quantity": 2 }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  When an order is successfully processed, the associated promotion is automatically burned; no manual Burn API call required.
</Tip>

---

## **Use Case 3: Payment-Based Promotion (Fintech or Subscriptions)**

### **Scenario**

A fintech app offers a **SAR 25 promotion** on wallet top-ups using the **PAYBILL25** promotion code.

After confirming the transaction, the app must burn the promotion to finalize it.

### **How to Implement**

Once validation and payment success are confirmed, call the [**Burn API **](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/burn-coupon)as follows:

```json
{
  "customerId": "USER_902",
  "lockReference": "lock-8c34d2a1-c8e0-4a9b-9317-2a9bfc1dc728"
}
```

#### **Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "burnedAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
}
```

## Best Practice

<Check>
   Always validate promotions before applying or burning them.
</Check>

<Check>
  Burn promotions only after/during successful order or payment confirmation.
</Check>

<Check>
  When using `redemption.couponsLockReferen`ce in the Order API, a separate burn call isn’t required.
</Check>

<Check>
  If the order or payment fails, use the [Release API](https://gameball.mintlify.app/api-reference/coupons/release-coupons) to unlock the promotion.
