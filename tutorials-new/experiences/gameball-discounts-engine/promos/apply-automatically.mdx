# Apply Promos Automatically

Gameball’s **Automatic Promo API** lets you apply valid, active promotions directly to a customer’s order, without requiring them to enter a promo code.\
This helps you deliver a **seamless checkout experience**, where promotions are evaluated, matched, and applied automatically based on the order’s details and customer profile.

---

## Why This Matters

Manual coupon entry can interrupt the checkout experience and lead to missed redemptions.\
With **automatic promos**, Gameball determines which active offers apply to the order — such as spend thresholds, collection-based rules, or loyalty tier discounts — and applies them instantly.

This ensures:

- 💡 **Frictionless checkout:** Customers see eligible discounts automatically.
- 🎯 **Personalized offers:** Gameball evaluates each customer’s eligibility in real time.
- 🔁 **Consistent rule enforcement:** Prevents stacking or invalid promo combinations.
- 📊 **Accurate tracking:** Discounts and rewards are logged and attributed properly in analytics.

## When to Use It

You should call this API when:

| Scenario                             | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛒 **Checkout Page**                 | You want Gameball to automatically apply all valid promotions based on cart contents.                     |
| 🏪 **POS Checkout**                  | In-store checkout flow where customers don’t manually enter promo codes.                                  |
| 💳 **Payments or Fintech Use Cases** | You want Gameball to automatically apply discounts or cashback promos to bill payments or wallet top-ups. |

## How It Works

When you call the [**Automatic Coupons API**](/api-reference/coupons/automatic-coupons), you send the order payload (like you would in the [**Calculate Cashback API**](/api-reference/transactions/cashback-and-redemptions/cashback)).

Gameball then:

1. Evaluates the order against all **active promotions** configured in your workspace.
2. Filters the ones that match the criteria (e.g., collections, minimum spend, customer tier).
3. Returns the **best applicable promotions**, including discount details, type, and value.
