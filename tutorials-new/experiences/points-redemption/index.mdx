## What is the Concept of Redemption?

Redemption enables customers to **convert their accumulated points into valuable rewards**, such as discounts or free shipping.

### Example Scenario

> **Adam**, a loyal customer of your food delivery business, has accumulated **1,000 points** after 10 orders.\
> You can reward Adam by allowing him to redeem his points for:
>
> - **A direct discount** applied at checkout
> - 10% off Coupon
> - Any other coupon types supported by Gameball

✨ **Business Impact:** Redemption not only delivers tangible value but also encourages repeat purchases and long-term engagement.

## Redemption Flow (Customer Journey Overview)

Redemption is not just a technical process; it’s a **key customer moment** in the loyalty journey.\
Here’s how it typically unfolds across your app or website:

### 1. Earn Points Through Engagement

Customers accumulate points by completing various actions on your platform:

- Placing an order
- Referring a friend
- Writing a review
- Completing a campaign challenge

> **Example:** Adam earns **1,000 points** after placing an order worth $1,000 (1 point per $1 spent).

### 2. Discover & Redeem Points

When Adam returns to place a new order, he finds available redemption options.

At this stage, your UI (cart page, rewards center, or profile widget) can present **two redemption paths**, depending on your configuration.

**Option A: Pay with Points**

Customers can instantly apply their available points as a **direct discount at checkout**, similar to using store credit. The system calculates the eligible discount and applies it to the cart total in real time.

**Option B: Convert Points into a Reward or a Coupon:**

Customers can choose to exchange their points for a **reward**, such as a coupon code or other configured benefit. The redeemed reward can then be applied manually during checkout.

### 3. Discount Confirmed, Order Placed

Once the discount (direct or via coupon) is applied, Adam proceeds to place his order, feeling rewarded and more likely to return.
