# Points Redemption Integration

Redemption is a pivotal Gameball feature that transforms customer loyalty points into tangible rewards.\
By integrating redemption options, businesses can boost repeat purchases and foster customer loyalty.

This guide walks you through:

- How redemption works
- The two implementation paths available
- How to choose the right one for your setup

---

## What is the Concept of Redemption?

Redemption enables customers to **convert their accumulated points into valuable rewards**, such as discounts or free shipping.

### Example Scenario

> **Adam**, a loyal customer of your food delivery business, has accumulated **1,000 points** after 10 orders.\
> You can reward Adam by allowing him to redeem his points for:
>
> - 10% off
> - Free shipping
> - Any other coupon types supported by Gameball

✨ **Business Impact:** Redemption not only delivers tangible value but also encourages repeat purchases and long-term engagement.

## Redemption Flow (Customer Journey Overview)

Redemption is not just a technical process; it’s a **key customer moment** in the loyalty journey.\
Here’s how it typically unfolds across your app or website:

### 1. Earn Points Through Engagement

Customers accumulate points by completing various actions on your platform:

- Placing an order
- Referring a friend
- Writing a review
- Completing a campaign challenge

> **Example:** Adam earns **1,000 points** after placing an order worth $1,000 (1 point per $1 spent).

---

### 2. Discover Redemption Options

When Adam returns to place a new order, he finds available redemption options.\
At this moment, your UI (cart page, rewards center, or profile widget) can present **two clear paths**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Apply Points Directly">
    Instantly apply available points as a **discount at checkout**, similar to using store credit.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Convert Points to a Coupon">
    Exchange points for a **discount coupon** that can be applied manually at checkout.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### 3. Redeem & Apply the Selected Option

Depending on your configuration, one or both redemption paths may be available:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Points Redemption">
    Customers can apply points directly at checkout.\
    The system calculates and applies the eligible discount **instantly** to the cart total.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Coupon-Based Redemption">
    Customers can exchange points for a **unique coupon code**, which they apply at checkout.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> You can enable **either or both** options depending on your desired flexibility and promotional strategy.

---

### 4. Discount Confirmed, Order Placed

Once the discount (direct or via coupon) is applied, Adam proceeds to place his order, feeling rewarded and more likely to return.
