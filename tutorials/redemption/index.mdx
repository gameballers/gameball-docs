Redemption is one of Gameball core features, designed to enhance customer engagement by allowing them to convert their collected points into discounts or rewards when placing new orders. This guide will provide an overview of how the redemption feature works, the options available for integrating it into your business, and help you decide which method suits your infrastructure best.

#### What is the Concept of Redemption?

Redemption is the process through which customers can use their accumulated points to get discounts or rewards, thereby encouraging repeat purchases and increasing customer loyalty. In essence, redemption adds value to the points customers earn by converting them into tangible benefits.

_Example_: Adam, a loyal customer of your food delivery business, has accumulated 1000 points after 10 orders in a month. You can reward Adam by allowing him to redeem his points for discounts such as 10% off or free shipping, or any other coupon types supported by Gameball.

#### The Two Ways of Redemption and Their Differences

Gameball supports two main ways for customers to redeem their points:

1. **Direct Debit Redemption**: Customers redeem points directly at checkout as a form of currency to pay for part or all of their order, without needing a coupon.
2. **Coupon Redemption**: Customers can exchange points for discount coupons that can be applied during checkout. This method is versatile, allowing for various types of coupons such as percentage discounts, free shipping, and more.

Each method offers flexibility depending on your business needs and the customer experience you aim to create. Both options can work in parallel to offer a seamless redemption experience for your users.
