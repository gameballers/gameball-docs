A well-designed leaderboard can drive engagement by showcasing customer rankings, progress, and achievements. By using the [Leaderboard API](../../rest-api/leaderboard), you can create a dynamic and interactive leaderboard that highlights top-performing customers and keeps everyone motivated to level up.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to use the API to:

- **Fetch Customer Leaderboard Data**: Retrieve real-time rankings, tier information, and progress for your customers.
- **Showcase Ranks and Achievements**: Display customer positions on the leaderboard along with their earned rewards and milestones.
- **Highlight Progress**: Make it easy for users to track how close they are to the next rank or reward, motivating continued participation.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to create an engaging leaderboard that not only highlights top customers but also encourages others to strive for the next tier.

#### **Ideas for Display**

1. **Leaderboard Overview**
   - Display a ranked list of customers with:
     - **Display Name:** Show customer names prominently (e.g., "John Doe").
     - **Rank:** Indicate their rank in the leaderboard.
     - **Progress:** Highlight points or progress contributing to their rank.

2. **Customer-Specific Rank**
   - Provide a personalized section for the logged-in customer:
     - Highlight their rank, progress, and tier information.
     - Mention the total number of customers participating (e.g., “Rank 1 out of 100”).
3. **Tier Visualization**
   - Display each customer's tier using their `tierIcon` alongside their name and rank for instant visual recognition.
4. **Filters for Leaderboard View**
   - Allow filtering options for customers to explore leaderboard results by specific time frames:
     - **Today’s leaderboard:**

       ```http
       http://api.gameball.co/api/v4/integrations/leaderboard?from=2024-11-24 00:00
       ```
     - **Last month’s leaderboard:**

       ```http
       http://api.gameball.co/api/v4/integrations/leaderboard?from=2024-10-01 00:00&to=2024-10-31 23:59
       ```
     - **All-time leaderboard:** (No filters required)

       ```http
       http://api.gameball.co/api/v4/integrations/leaderboard
       ```
     - **Specific customer rank within a time frame:**

       ```http
       http://api.gameball.co/api/v4/integrations/leaderboard?from=2024-10-01 00:00&to=2024-10-31 23:59&playerUniqueId=player456
       ```
5. **Progress Indicators**
   - Include a progress bar to visually represent each customer’s progress relative to the highest rank.
   - Optionally, show percentage-based progress or milestones.
6. **Call-to-Action for Engagement**
   - Add actionable prompts, such as "Boost your rank by earning more points!" to encourage interaction.
