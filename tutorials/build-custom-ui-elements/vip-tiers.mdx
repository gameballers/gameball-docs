# VIP Tiers

VIP tiers are a fantastic way to reward your most loyal customers and keep them engaged. But to make the most of this feature, it’s important to give customers a clear and motivating way to see their progress and the benefits waiting for them as they move up the tiers.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to combine two key APIs to create an engaging and informative experience for your customers:

- [Get Tiers Configurations API](../../../rest-api/configurations/program-configurations#get-tiers-configurations): Fetch all the details about the available VIP tiers, including the benefits and requirements for each level.
- [Get Customer Tier Progress API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-tier-progress): Show customers their real-time progress and how close they are to reaching the next tier.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. How to display available VIP tiers with their benefits and requirements.
2. How to show each customer’s progress toward the next tier.
3. How to create a seamless and motivating experience that encourages customers to keep moving up the ranks.

By the end, you’ll have the tools to build a feature that not only highlights your VIP program but also keeps your customers engaged and excited about reaching the next level. Let’s get started!

***

### **1️⃣ Step 1: Fetch All Available Tiers**

To start, you need to call the [Tiers Configurations API](../../../rest-api/configurations/program-configurations#get-tiers-configurations) to fetch the available tiers and their associated benefits. This endpoint will return the details of each tier, including the **name**, **icon**, **minimum progress required**, and **benefits** for each tier.

**Sample Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Basic",
        "minProgress": 0,
        "order": 1,
        "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/gb-library/levels-icons/level-a1.webp",
        "benefits": [
            {
                "type": "Entry Reward",
                "rankReward": 0,
                "walletReward": 0
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Bronze",
        "minProgress": 30,
        "order": 2,
        "icon": "level-a2",
        "benefits": [
            {
                "type": "Entry Reward",
                "rankReward": 0,
                "walletReward": 12,
                "couponReward": {
                    "couponType": "0",
                    "discountValue": null,
                    "minOrderValue": null,
                    "product": null,
                    "collections": [],
                    "options": {
                        "expiryAfter": null,
                        "usageLimit": 1,
                        "usedCount": 0,
                        "capping": null,
                        "minReward": null,
                        "minOrderValue": null,
                        "isCashback": null,
                        "applyToFees": null,
                        "combinesWith": {
                            "orderDiscounts": false,
                            "productDiscounts": false,
                            "shippingDiscounts": false
                        },
                        "productId": null,
                        "productName": null,
                        "variantId": null,
                        "variantName": null,
                        "productDisplayName": null,
                        "couponPrefix": null,
                        "collections": [],
                        "productDisplayNames": [],
                        "hasCollections": false,
                        "platforms": [],
                        "redeemInstructions": [],
                        "instructions": null,
                        "source": null,
                        "couponName": null
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Loyalty Points Earning Custom Configuration",
                "rewardWalletFactor": 70.0
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Silver",
        "minProgress": 700,
        "order": 3,
        "icon": "level-a1",
        "benefits": []
    },
    {
        "name": "Gold",
        "minProgress": 6001,
        "order": 4,
        "icon": "level-a1",
        "benefits": []
    }
]
```

#### **Visual Suggestion**:

For a more engaging display, you can use **icons** for each tier to help customers visually distinguish between them. 

**Icons**: Use small, recognizable images or symbols to represent each tier (e.g., a gold medal for the "Gold" tier).

### **2️⃣ Step 2: Fetch Customer Progress for VIP Tiers**

Once the tiers are fetched, the next step is to call the [Customer Tier Progress API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-tier-progress)  to get the current progress of the logged-in customer.

**Sample Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "tierName": "Gold",
    "tierId": 1234,
    "completionPercentage": 50.0,
    "achievedPoints": 95,
    "nextTierProgress": 190
  },
  {
    "tierName": "Platinum",
    "tierId": 5678,
    "completionPercentage": 0.0,
    "achievedPoints": 0,
    "nextTierProgress": 500
  }
]
```

#### **Visual Suggestion**:

The progress for each tier can be displayed in various ways:

1. **Progress Bar**: For each tier, you can use a **progress bar** to show how much progress the user has made. For example, if the user is halfway to the "Gold" tier (50%), the progress bar would be filled up to 50% to visually represent this.
2. **Completion Percentage**: Show the **completion percentage** next to each tier. For instance, "50% complete" for a user who has made halfway progress to the "Gold" tier.
3. **Locked Tiers**: For tiers that the customer has not unlocked yet (e.g., "Platinum"), you could gray out the tier and add a small text overlay like **"Locked"** or **"Progress: 0/500 points"**.

#### **3️⃣ Step 3: Combine Tiers and Progress for UI Display**

After fetching both the tier configuration and the customer progress, you can combine the data to create an interactive and motivating display. Here’s how the combined data can be shown:

**Completed Tiers:**

For completed tiers (100% progress), show the **tier icon** and **tier name** with the progress bar fully filled. The benefits for completed tiers should also be clearly displayed, and you can highlight the rewards that the user has unlocked.

- **Visual**: Use a **green progress bar** to indicate a completed tier and show the **"Claim Benefits"** button for the customer to redeem rewards.

**In-Progress Tiers:**

For in-progress tiers (e.g., 50% progress), show the **tier name**, **tier icon**, and a **progress bar** showing how far the customer has progressed. Add a motivating **call-to-action** like "Complete 50 more points to unlock Gold!" and display the available benefits for when the customer reaches this tier.

- **Visual**: Use an **orange progress bar** for in-progress tiers, and show a button like **"Level Up"** or **"Keep Going!"** to encourage the customer to continue earning points.

**Locked Tiers:**

For locked tiers, simply show the **tier name**, **tier icon**, and a progress bar that is empty (0%). Additionally, you could display a **text overlay** like "This tier is locked" or "Earn more points to unlock".

- **Visual**: Use a **gray progress bar** and show the message **"Locked"** in a faded style to indicate that the tier has not been reached.

***

#### **4️⃣ Key Visuals for VIP Tiers**:

1. **Progress Bars**:
   - Use **colored progress bars**: green for completed, orange for in-progress, and gray for locked.
2. **Tier Icons**:
   - Use **tier-specific icons** (golden badge, platinum badge) for easy recognition.
3. **Benefits List**:
   - Show a **list of benefits** for each tier, with any specific rewards and links to redeem or learn more about them.
