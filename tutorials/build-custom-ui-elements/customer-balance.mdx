Loyalty programs thrive when customers can easily see their rewards and understand their value. By using the [Get Customer Balance API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-balance), you can create a clear and motivating view of a customer's points balance, helping them track their earnings and see how close they are to redeeming rewards.

This guide will show you how to structure and present points data effectively, including key details like available points, pending points, and expiring points. With a thoughtful design, you can turn this information into a powerful tool that drives engagement and loyalty.

#### **Ideas for Display**

1. **Points Summary**

   - Available Points: Show points available for immediate use.
   - Pending Points: Display points pending approval, along with their value.

2. **Call-to-Action Section**
   - Emphasize available points and their redemption potential (e.g., "Redeem 1200 points to save $60!").
3. **Expiring Points Alert**
   - Notify customers about upcoming expiring points and their expiration date.
4. **Progress Indicator**
   - Show a progress bar or similar visual element to indicate pending or expiring points relative to the total.
5. **Points Breakdown**
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of all categories, such as total earned points, available points, pending points, and expiring points.
6. **Currency and Naming Information**
   - Display the currency (e.g., USD) and configured name for the points (e.g., "Reward Points") for consistent branding.
