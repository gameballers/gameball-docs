Keeping customers informed about their account activities, such as points adjustments or new rewards, is essential for maintaining engagement. With the [Customer Notifications API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-notifications#get-customer-notifications), you can easily fetch, manage, and display these notifications in a clear and meaningful way.

This guide will show you how to leverage the API to provide an intuitive notification experience, including:

- **Fetching Customer Notifications**: Retrieve a list of important updates and present them in a user-friendly format, with key details such as titles, messages, and their read status.
- **Managing Notifications with Pagination**: When dealing with a large number of notifications, pagination helps break them down into easily navigable chunks, making it easier for users to stay on top of their updates.
- **Customizing Notifications**: Tailor the experience by offering language options and adjusting the design for better accessibility and engagement.
- **Marking Notifications as Read**: Allow customers to mark notifications as read, ensuring they can easily keep track of what‚Äôs new and what they‚Äôve already seen.

By following this guide, you'll be able to provide a seamless notification experience that keeps your users informed and engaged, enhancing their overall experience with your app or website.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Fetch Customer Notifications

To fetch the customer notifications, use the [**Get Customer Notifications** API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-notifications#get-customer-notifications). This will return a list of notifications for the customer.

**Response Body:**

```json
{
    "notifications": [
        {
            "notificationId": "15227561",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "Buy over 500$ and get 10$ üí∞ earned. Enjoy your rewards and keep earning more!",
            "isRead": false,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:39:13.792Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Client_9423/2b2efc2f-b85e-4cce-baf6-380454e4d62ccash.webp"
        },
        {
            "notificationId": "15227560",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "First Order earned. Enjoy your rewards and keep earning more!",
            "isRead": false,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:39:13.067Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Client_9423/1de5b89b-a7c4-44d9-a9cb-5e374e051938order.webp"
        },
        {
            "notificationId": "15227558",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "You have received 100 Points for your last order. Your current Points balance is 100.",
            "isRead": true,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:39:11.104Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Notifications/cachback.webp"
        },
        {
            "notificationId": "15227475",
            "title": "Congratulations!",
            "body": "Welcome to the family üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è earned. Enjoy your rewards and keep earning more!",
            "isRead": true,
            "createdAt": "2024-11-19T13:28:50.1Z",
            "lang": "en",
            "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/Client_9423/432841da-4398-48c5-ada3-e3a60f081dd1family2.webp"
        }
    ],
    "count": 4,
    "hasMore": false
}
```

**What Happens on the Frontend:**

- Render notifications in a list format with the notification title and body.
- Include the notification icon (optional) for visual appeal.
- Display whether the notification has been read or not.

#### Customizing and Navigating Notifications

#### Pagination in Customer Notifications

If your application involves displaying a large number of notifications, you can take advantage of **pagination** to break the notifications into manageable chunks. In the response, you'll see two useful attributes to help with pagination:

- **count**: The number of notifications returned in the current response (this corresponds to the number of items on the current page).
- **hasMore**: A boolean that indicates if there are more notifications that can be fetched.

This allows you to implement a **paging system** in your UI, enabling users to navigate through pages of notifications. For example:

- On the first page, you might show notifications 1‚Äì10.
- If there are more notifications, you can show a "Next" button to fetch the next page (using `hasMore`).
- If you're on the last page, you can show a "Previous" button to go back.

This keeps the notifications section user-friendly and ensures you don‚Äôt overwhelm users with too much data at once.

***

#### Customizing Notifications by Language

By default, notifications are returned in the system‚Äôs default language, indicated by the **lang** attribute in the API response. However, if your customers want to see notifications in a different language (e.g., French or Spanish), you can provide them the option to do so.

To fetch notifications in a different language, pass the desired language code as a query parameter in your request. Examples:

- English: `lang=en`
- Spanish: `lang=es`

Request URL example (Spanish):

```http
https://api.gameball.co/api/v4.0/integrations/customer/{customerId}/notifications?lang=es
```

By offering this feature, your app can cater to a broader audience and ensure that notifications are clear and accessible to all customers, regardless of their preferred language.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Mark Notifications as Read

When the customer views their notifications, you might want to mark them as read. This can be done through the [**Mark Notifications as Read**](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-notifications#put-mark-customer-notifications-as-read) API. You'll need to pass the `notificationId` for each notification that you want to mark as read.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "notificationsIds": [15227561, 15227560]
}
```

**What Happens on the Frontend:**

- Once the notification is marked as read, update its status visually (e.g., changing the color or icon) to reflect that it's been read.
