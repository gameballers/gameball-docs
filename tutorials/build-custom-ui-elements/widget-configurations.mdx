description: "Building Adaptive UI Elements with the Configurations API"
---

When designing user interfaces for your app or website, it’s crucial that the UI adapts seamlessly to the changing configurations set within Gameball. Whether it’s temporarily disabling a feature like the cashback program during the financial year-end or adjusting to new business rules, having an adaptive UI ensures a smooth user experience without the need for frequent code updates or redeployments.

With the [Widget Configurations API](../../../rest-api/configurations/widget-configuration#get-widget-configurations), you can dynamically update your UI elements based on real-time changes within the Gameball platform. This eliminates the need for manual updates each time there is a configuration change, offering a more efficient and responsive way to reflect business decisions.

In this guide, we’ll explore how to:

- **Dynamically Adapt UI Elements**: Automatically show or hide components like cashback options or leaderboards based on configuration changes.
- **Retrieve Program Configurations**: Get real-time status updates of different Gameball programs and adjust your UI accordingly.
- **Implement Business Decisions**: Reflect operational decisions, like disabling or enabling features (e.g., Cashback), without requiring a full redeployment of your UI.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to use to create a more flexible and adaptable interface that responds to changes in real time, improving both the user experience and development efficiency.

#### Example: Widget Configurations API Response

The Configurations API returns a set of configuration flags, which control the visibility and status of various Gameball programs. Below is a sample response from the [**Widget Configurations API**](../../rest-api/configurations/widget-configuration):

```json
{
  "gameballEnabled": true,
  "redemptionEnabled": true,
  "cashbackEnabled": true,
  "visitorProfileEnabled": true,
  "userProfileEnabled": true,
  "leaderboardEnabled": true,
  "notificationsEnabled": true,
  "currency": "EGP",
  "programName": "Loyalty Program",
  "rankPointsName": "Score",
  "walletPointsName": "Points",
  "botMainColor": "#E7633F"
}
```

#### Adaptive UI Based on Flags:

In this response, there are several flags that determine whether different Gameball features should be enabled or disabled in your app/webpage:

- **gameballEnabled**: If `false`, all Gameball-related UI elements should be disabled or hidden.
- **cashbackEnabled**: If `false`, elements related to the Cashback program (like cashback balance, cashback offers, etc.) should be hidden.
- **notificationsEnabled**: If `false`, notifications should not be displayed.

#### Example Scenario:

Let’s consider a scenario where the `cashbackEnabled` flag is set to `false`. This means any UI elements related to the cashback program, such as cashback balances or offers, should be disabled or hidden. Similarly, when the `gameballEnabled` flag is `false`, all Gameball-related features (including Cashback, Profile, Leaderboards, etc.) should be hidden regardless of the individual program’s status.

#### Steps to Integrate the Configurations API:

1. **Make an API Request**: Call the **Configurations API** to retrieve the current settings and configurations.
2. **Parse the Response**: Based on the response flags, conditionally render or hide UI components.
3. **Reflect Business Decisions Dynamically**: Use the response to dynamically adapt the UI to reflect any changes, without requiring code redeployment.

#### Important Notes:

- **Dynamic Business Decisions**: The configurations API ensures your UI remains consistent with any business decisions made through the Gameball dashboard without needing to redeploy your application.
- **No Code Changes Required**: Simply use the flags returned by the API to control visibility in your UI, based on your current configuration.
