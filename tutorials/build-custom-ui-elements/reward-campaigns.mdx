# Reward Campaigns

Reward campaigns are a great way to inspire and engage your customers. But to make them truly effective, customers need a simple and clear way to see what‚Äôs available and how they‚Äôre progressing. That‚Äôs where a thoughtful approach to displaying reward campaigns comes in.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll show you how to use two essential APIs to create a user experience that‚Äôs both interactive and transparent:

- [Get Reward Campaigns Configurations API](../../../rest-api/configurations/program-configurations#get-campaigns-configurations) :This gives you all the details about active campaigns‚Äîwhat they‚Äôre about, the rewards on offer, and who‚Äôs eligible.
- [Get Customer Reward Campaigns Progress API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-campaigns-progress) : With this, you can show real-time updates on how close someone is to earning their rewards.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll walk through:

1. How to display active campaigns with all the details customers care about.
2. How to track progress so customers can see exactly where they stand.
3. How to bring it all together in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand and engaging.

By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll know exactly how to give customers the information they need to stay motivated and excited about your reward campaigns. Let‚Äôs get started!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 1: Fetch All Available Reward Campaigns**

Use the [Get Reward Campaigns Configurations API](../../rest-api/configurations/reward-configurations)  endpoint to list all active and visible campaigns. This response provides:

- **Campaign Name and Icon**: Display campaign names like "Join our family üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" and their corresponding icons to create a visually engaging list.
- **Description**: Use descriptions to explain the campaign, e.g., "Welcome to the family! Check out your new reward for signing up üòâ".
- **Rewards**: Highlight the rewards customers will earn, such as double points (`walletRewardFactor: 2`).
- **Visibility and Activation**: Ensure only visible and active campaigns are displayed based on `visibility` and `activation` fields.

***

**Example Campaign Data:**

```json
{
    "id": 5858,
    "name": "Join our family üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
    "description": "Welcome to the family! Check out your new reward for signing up üòâ",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rankReward": 0,
            "walletReward": 0,
            "walletRewardFactor": null,
            "couponReward": null
        }
    ],
    "icon": "https://cdn.gameball.co/uploads/gb-library/general/signup.webp"
}
```

**What Happens on the Frontend**:

- Render the campaigns as a scrollable **grid or list**, with icons and descriptions.
- Add a **‚ÄúCheck Your Rewards‚Äù** button using the `redirectionButtonText` and `redirectionButtonLink` fields.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 2: Fetch Customer Progress for Campaigns**

To provide a personalized experience, fetch progress for the displayed campaigns using the `/customers/rewards-campaigns-progress` endpoint. This response includes:

- **achievedCount**: Indicates how many times the customer has achieved the campaign.
- **completionPercentage**: Shows progress for ongoing campaigns (e.g., 33% for "Third Order Campaign üõçÔ∏è").

***

**Example Progress Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "rewardsCampaignName": "Join our family üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
        "rewardsCampaignId": 5858,
        "completionPercentage": 100.0,
        "achievedCount": 1
    },
    {
        "rewardsCampaignName": "Double points",
        "rewardsCampaignId": 6652,
        "completionPercentage": 50.0,
        "achievedCount": 0
    }
]
```

**What Happens on the Frontend**:

- Use **completionPercentage** to display progress as a **progress bar or circle**.
- Highlight completed campaigns where `completionPercentage = 100` and dim or gray-out incomplete campaigns.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 3: Integrating Rewards and Progress**

Combine data from both endpoints to create a seamless user experience:

**For Completed Campaigns:**

- Use `achievedCount` and `completionPercentage = 100` to highlight campaigns.
- Show rewards (e.g., "Sign-up bonus unlocked!") prominently for completed campaigns.

**For Ongoing Campaigns:**

- Use `completionPercentage` to display a progress bar (e.g., "50% complete").
- Include a call-to-action, such as "Complete your next purchase to earn double points!" using the campaign description or custom text.

**For Locked Campaigns:**

- Dim or hide campaigns where `isUnlocked = false`.

***

**Visual Mockup Suggestion:**

1. **Grid Layout of Campaigns**:
   - Campaign name and icon at the top.
   - Progress bar or circle beneath the name.
   - Rewards displayed below the progress bar (e.g., "Earn 2x points!").
2. **Color Coding**:
   - Use green for completed campaigns, orange for in-progress, and gray for locked.
3. **Actionable Buttons**:
   - Include ‚ÄúClaim Reward‚Äù for completed campaigns or ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù for ongoing ones.

***

#### Example UI Flow:

1. **Step 1**: Sarah logs into her account and sees a list of reward campaigns:
   - **"Join our family üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"**: Completed with a glowing green progress bar.
   - **"Double points"**: 50% complete with an orange progress bar.
   - **"Third Order Campaign üõçÔ∏è"**: Not started, dimmed icon.
2. **Step 2**: Sarah clicks "Check Your Rewards" and sees detailed rewards for each campaign, including wallet rewards or coupon links.
3. **Step 3**: Sarah is motivated to complete "Double points" by making another purchase.

***

#### Why This Matters:

Combining the [Get Reward Campaigns Configurations API](../../rest-api/configurations/reward-configurations) and the [Get Customer Reward Campaigns Progress API](../../../rest-api/customers/customer-progress#get-customer-campaigns-progress) ensures:

- **Personalized Experience**: Customers can track their progress and rewards in real time.
- **Increased Engagement**: Clear visual indicators motivate customers to complete campaigns.
- **Streamlined Interaction**: Integrated call-to-action buttons encourage immediate participation.
